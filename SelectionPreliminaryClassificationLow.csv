12389;An Innovative Approach to Improve the Performances of the Research Community;This proposal adopts an approach based on a synergy between collaborative learning theories, semantic technologies and soft computing techniques to improve the performances of a research community. It is proposed a model of Virtual Organization based on three interconnected layers that can facilitate in-time retrieval of geo-located competences and skills, the recall of ad hoc services for setting a collaborative-oriented workspace and the access to geo-referenced resource repositories. This model proposes an experimental use of the Semantic Web (Domain Ontologies, Taxonomies, Upper Ontologies, etc...) and we will explain the added value it can bring to the Knowledge Communities research field.
12410;CISIS 2012 Keynote;Summary form only given. The wealth of European companies has progressively shifted from tangible assets (capital, resources) into intangible ones like knowledge, competency, reputation, innovation processes and motivation. Intangibles are closely related the natural interactions occurring normally in work practices. This is where ideas, innovation, learning, knowledge (in all its various forms), relationships, social cohesion, synergistically contribute to performance, competition differentiators and value creation. Creativity and innovation inside organizations are directly related to the way people learn (informally and/or formally), collaborate, and share ideas and experience. The support of these activities within the Enterprise it is provided by several tools and environments. This doesn't help to capture and elicitate the possible intangible assets. Even in the case where some pieces of knowledge could be extracted and captured we have the problem to provide them with a useful meaning through formalization with respect to working context (i.e. correlate them to organizational processes, objectives, tasks). The aim of this invited speech is to present the methodologies for knowledge building developed in the context of ARISTOTELE, a European Integrated Project. The methodologies for knowledge building are used for extracting tacit knowledge and using ontology matching and merging approaches to conceptualize it, with respect to models that exploit semantic web schemas (SIOC, SKOS, FOAF, MOAT, etc.) for representing different enterprise aspects like competency, worker profile, learning experience, enterprise assets.
12474;Integrating Trust and Competency Management to Improve Learning;Nowadays, the importance of knowledge management is well understood by managers in the organizations and, at the same time, the great significance of trust, in enabling effective knowledge sharing, is emerging. Presence or lack of trust can have serious implications for organizations with respect to the quality and of their business processes. Several scientific works have confirmed the direct correlation between social-cognitive capital, in terms of competencies and experiences, and a feeling of trust in both learning and working collaborative environments. On the other hand, Competency-Based Management allows organizations to link human resources processes to competencies in order to shape its workforce capabilities and to achieve better results. Typically, employees' competencies (and proficiency levels) are stored and used by specific enterprise software, whereas the trust is not considered or left to managers' feeling. This work proposes an approach to the improvement of collaborative learning activities by refining and allowing (at workers' level) competency-finding processes through the social calculus of trust-in-competencies degree.
12491;SCALE: A Smart Competence Analytics Solution for English Writing;This paper proposes a competence analytics framework called SCALE (Smart Competence Analytics on LEarning) and highlights how it can be applied to track the formation and development of learners' competences in the English writing domain. SCALE is essentially a generic competence analytics solution designed for all learning domains. This paper shows in detail how SCALE collects in a timely manner evidences to track the development of English writing skills. As new evidences come in, every competence will be re-assessed quantitatively so that every change in competence level can be recorded over time. Using an experimental dataset, the paper concludes by exhibiting a subset of insights possible with SCALE.
12495;Workplace learning - providing recommendations of experts and learning resources in a context-sensitive and personalized manner: An approach for ontology supported workplace learning;Support of workplace learning is increasingly important as change in every form determines today's working world in industry and public administrations alike. Adapt quickly to a new job, a new task or a new team is a major challenge that must be dealt with ever faster. Workplace learning differs significantly from school learning as it should be strictly aligned to business goals. In our approach we support workplace learning by providing recommendations of experts and learning resources in a context-sensitive and personalized manner. We utilize users' workplace environment, we consider their learning preferences and zone of proximal development, and compare required and acquired competencies in order to issue the best suited recommendations. Our approach is part of the European funded project Learn PAd. Applied research method is Design Science Research. Evaluation is done in an iterative process. The recommender system introduced here is evaluated theoretically based on user requirements and practically in an early evaluation process conducted by the Learn PAd application partner.
12500;Enhanced semantic automatic ontology enrichment;With the fast growing development of the Web, the adoption of ontologies to improve the exploitation of information resources, is already heralded as a promising model of representation. However, the relevance of information that they contain requires regular updating, and specifically, the addition of new knowledge. Recently, new research approaches were defined in order to automatically enrich ontology. Usually they extensively use either statistical models or experts to provide the relevance and placement of new concepts. Unfortunately these approaches suffer the following drawback: The detection of new elements and position in ontology are not automatically established, and lack of use of semantic or syntactic information to extract relations between concepts. In this paper, we present an approach for ontology enrichment based on two steps where a novel effective filtering step is utilized. First we extract the correlation between terms of a learning dataset using the generation of association rules. Second we retain the relevant new concepts using an extracted semantic information. The suggested approach was tested on an ontology of mechanical industry competencies. Experiments were performed on real data, which show the usefulness of our approach.
12512;Towards evaluating ontology based data matching strategies matching strategies, evaluation methodology and results;In the EC FP6 Prolix project, a generic ontology-based data matching framework (ODMF) is developed for enhancing competency management and e-learning processes. In this paper, we will focus on ODMF matching strategies and an evaluation methodology for the evaluation. We will discuss the evaluation principles and evaluation criteria in general. This evaluation methodology is applied to enterprises and being validated. The evaluation results and valuable concluding points concerning an evaluation methodology will be explained.
12640;An Adult Learner's Knowledge Model Based on Ontologies and Rule Reasoning;One of the biggest challenges of Adaptive e-learning systems is learner modelling. The learner model should represent the learner's characteristics as faithfully as possible in order to provide adaptive learning. Among these characteristics, the learner's knowledge is considered to be the core characteristic of the learner model, as adaptive e-learning systems are centered on the learner's knowledge, since acquiring « knowledge » about a specific domain or concept is considered the main goal of learning and instruction. In this paper, we propose a novel adult learner's knowledge model using ontologies and rule reasoning, by trying to define the different components that construct the learner's knowledge in an exhaustive yet a simple way. The proposed model takes into account different elements of the learner's knowledge, such as the different knowledge types and categories, the learner's prior knowledge accumulated through his/her experiences, his/her misconceptions, errors and the previously learned but forgotten knowledge.
12641;Mobile Learning and Integration of Advanced Technologies in Education;Basic problems of advanced forms of education are insufficient flexibility, mobility and adaptability to learners needs of information and education whenever and wherever it is necessary. Some of the problems find their solution in capabilities of mobile education. Basic characteristics, advantages and existing challenges to that new and most flexible form of learning are presented in the paper. Issues of integration and combination of collaborative learning characteristics and functionalities of mobile technologies are overviewed. Strategic solutions for learning types development and integration of advanced technologies in different forms of education are presented.
12644;Competence Web-Based Assessment for Lifelong Learning;Recent years have witnessed the important increase of the lifelong learning, fostered by the continuous development of Web-based assessment. Assessment is a crucial component of learning. Assessment activity is practical not only in formal learning, but also in view of employability and further lifelong training activities. In light of trends toward increased requirements for skilled workers, Web-based assessment presents today many challenges. It should address students' real performance in life. Although attempts have been made to address some aspects of competence-based assessment, this kind of assessment has to go a step further. Issues such as evidence, assessment grid and feedback should be tackled. This paper presents the essential components behind a competence web-based assessment model that will lead to the design of our framework as well as some challenges involved behind a real scenario description.
12645;Supporting Adaptive Learning Interactions with Ontologies;The concept of adaptive technologies is increasingly prevalent in many areas, particularly in learning. In this context we require quick and robust approaches for developing adaptive learning environments. In order to construct such environments, we need to enable reusability of learning contents according to the needs of learners, which is one of the challenges for current learning technologies. In this paper we show how an ontology-based approach can help us to reuse the same learning contents for different purposes.
12646;Enhance Employees' Competences through Customized Learning;"In modern society, competent employees are an important asset for any organization to be competitive. Employees can be competent in their jobs when they have required skills imposed by the organization to which they belong. Providing necessary skill sets to each employee can be cumbersome because their background and existing skill sets are different; so any uniform training attempt may be inefficient and costly. So in order to provide necessary skills to each employee effectively, the training must be customized. In our approach, we analyze employees' existing skill sets using their learner profile and determine necessary training by comparing organizations' required skill sets. We utilize European Skills, Competences and Occupations classification (ESCO) and Dublin Core to store available Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) courses using the concept of learning object and learning object repository. We then present required training in terms of a study plan that includes a list of MOOC courses."
12649;Learning Systems as Ontology-Based Learning Object Repository;This paper focuses on comparative analysis of existing models of e-learning systems. For this purpose we used sets of functional and non-functional criteria and we selected the most appropriate model for our type of education based on these criteria. We present classifications of existing types of e-leanring systems and we choose the most appropriate one for our education. Finally we used a set of criteria for well-design and developed software in order to check if selected model satisfies them.
12650;Competences Management in an Organizational Learning Context;Knowledge and competences capital of an organization is increasingly crucial. The organization survival depends mainly on its capacity to access new knowledge, to diffuse its competences quickly and to exploit and preserve its expertise fields efficiently and durably. Thus today, organizations are aware of the necessity to become learning organizations and to maximize organizational learning. Within the approach MEMORAe, we are interested in these learning forms. They are connected to the knowledge management practices and in this paper we present why and how we developed a learning environment based on the concept of learning organizational memory. This environment is a web platform using semantic annotations and Web2.0 technologies in order to organize, share and capitalize organizational competences, knowledge and resources.
12653;Moodle's Ontology Development from UML for Social Learning Network Analysis;The online learning called e-learning is a new learning path that offers to learners to study at their own pace and at the moments that suit them. It is in this perspective that the semantic web has known its emergence in the field of e-learning to offer platforms content more personalized and more adapted to student's and teacher's needs. Since Moodle is the most popular e-learning platform, we propose in this paper to build its OWL ontology by exploring the representative data that we collected from its UML class diagram. The choice of UML class diagram as a basis for data collection for the development of the ontology is justified by the fact that the transition from UML to OWL ontology brings ontology development process closer to the wider software engineering population. The built ontology brings also great benefit in the field of the Social Learning Network Analysis. Because it gives the opportunity to study the behavior of the platform users by giving meaning to their relationships instead of modelling them only as knots and edges.
12656;Using Visual Learning Analytics to Support Competence-Based Learning;Competence-based Learning has become more and more popular in the last few years and some researchers have claimed that formative assessment should be followed to improve the learning processes. In order to achieve the mastery of competencies, many lecturers have been required to adopt various and diverse applications in their courses to work on those competences. The use of several applications brings new challenges, as the information of the learning processes is distributed among these systems and getting a global picture of the evolution becomes much harder. Therefore, systems that enable gathering and unifying formative assessment information coming from various sources in order to extract significant information about the global learning process are needed. In this paper, we present a system called COBLE (Competence-Based Learning Environment) that supports Competence-based Learning and combines Visual Learning Analytics and recommendation aspects in order to promote the students' and lecturers' self-reflection about the learning and teaching processes. COBLE supports data from different sources to be integrated, providing the users with the complete report of what is going on in their courses.
12659;Lifelong Learning in Virtual Education Space with Intelligent Assistants;Learning is a highly complex process that has many different aspects of goals, flows, content and knowledge management, sharing, enhancement and provisioning. In order to serve a real education process, a Virtual Education Space (VES) specified as an intelligent, context-aware, scenario-oriented IoT ecosystem is being implemented in the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at the University of Plovdiv. This paper presents an approach aiming at expanding the space for lifelong learning. Furthermore, the supporting assistants, implemented as intelligent agents, are described for three subjects.
12660;The Hybrid Recommendation of Digital Educational Resources in a Distance Learning Environment: The Case of MOOC;"The accompaniment and the follow-up of the learners in an online training aim at helping the learner to carry out his or her training and to guarantee an adapted and quality learning. During a learning process, personalized search and recommendation of digital educational resources form aspects of this accompaniment. This article presents a search engine and a hybrid recommendation of digital educational resources. This engine allows for filtering and personalized search by providing adapted resources to the users' profiles on the one hand; on the other hand, to making a combination of the collaborative, the content-based and the semantic filtering to propose other additional resources. The semantic filtering is based on the exploitation of SPARQL queries from the system that we propose. They are executed on a remote server containing reusable vocabularies and formalized according to the linked data principles and technologies, such as the Lod Cloud. The result obtained is a set of linked terms to the keywords specified in the search query. These terms are then used to extend the search. We used a search test-set by keywords entered via a form and then we manually analyzed the linked terms obtained and the documents returned. The results obtained by our approach are satisfactory."
12661;Data Scientist Professional Revisited: Competences Definition and Assessment, Curriculum and Education Path Design;Data Science is maturing as a scientific and technology domain and creates a basis for new emerging technologies and data driven application domains. Educated and/or trained Data Scientist is becoming a critical component of the whole data driven science and technology ecosystem. It is important to revisit the Data Scientist Professional definition propose/identify effective approaches to Data Science competences and skills assessment that would allow developing customisable education and training curricula that would support organisational capacity building (effective HR management) and individual career development. The paper is discussing how the EDISON Data Science Framework can be used to solve these problems. New approaches to Data Science competences assessment is proposed that introduces the concept of acquired competence which is calculated based on the practitioner career path. Important aspect in targeted education and training for professionals is correct and effective education path building based on initial competences and knowledge assessment. The paper proposes a new approach in customised curriculum building by applying Bloom's Taxonomy to training courses sequence and timing/scheduling.
12663;Development and Use of Domain-Specific Learning Theories, Models, and Instruments in Computing Education;Use of theory within a field of research provides the foundation for designing effective research programs and establishing a deeper understanding of the results obtained. This, together with the emergence of domain-specific theory, is often taken as an indicator of the maturity of any research area. This article explores the development and subsequent usage of domain-specific theories and theoretical constructs (TCs) in computing education research (CER). All TCs found in 878 papers published in three major CER publication venues over the period 2005–2020 were identified and assessed to determine the nature and purpose of the constructs found. We focused more closely on areas related to learning, studying, and progression, where our analysis found 80 new TCs that had been developed, based on multiple epistemological perspectives. Several existing frameworks were used to categorize the areas of CER focus in which TCs were found, the methodology by which they were developed, and the nature and purpose of the TCs. A citation analysis was undertaken, with 1,727 citing papers accessed to determine to what extent and in what ways TCs had been used and developed to inform subsequent work, also considering whether these aspects vary according to different focus areas within computing education. We noted which TCs were used most often and least often, and we present several brief case studies that demonstrate progressive development of domain-specific theory. The exploration provides insights into trends in theory development and suggests areas in which further work might be called for. Our findings indicate a general interest in the development of TCs during the period studied, and we show examples of how different approaches to theory development have been used. We present a framework suggesting how strategies for developing new TCs in CER might be structured and discuss the nature of theory development in relation to the field of CER.
12664;Exploring Learning Resource Recommendation Approaches for Secondary Education;Recommender Systems are a well researched area and there are many approaches and algorithms solving different kind of problems. In TEL recommending appropriate learning resources is a common problem that cannot be generalized well due to different didactic strategies, educational needs and heterogeneous data sources. We therefore argue that a design science process is best suited to apply, combine and improve different established recommendation system approaches to TEL systems. In this paper, we report our architecture to support our design process and the lessons learned from our specific TEL use case. Finally, we conclude discussing the open problems, advantages of our architectural approach and directions for future research.
12670;Formal Competence-Based Assessment: On Closing the Gap between Academia and Industry;For many years, we have observed industry great efforts in defining higher workplace productivity. Mostly, these efforts are exploring the field with highlighting industrial expectations and issues. However, until the appropriate selection of the competent candidates, this remains far from being realistic. From this standpoint and recognizing the inadequacy of current traditional knowledge-based assessment systems in higher education to achieve performance visibility, we think we need to rethink how we design new assessment models that can respond to the corporate requirements of the 21st century and mirror the learners' competences. This concern has not been sufficiently investigated and only a minority provided some efforts to grant the fundamental models to assess Learners based on the standard required competences. Thus, the main output of this work is a semantic model and a framework specification for competence-based assessment to support the formal and informal learning competences visibility.
12693;An Ontology Based Linguistic Infrastructure to Represent Software Risk Identification Knowledge;Knowledge can be captured and made available to both machines and humans by an ontology. Ontology can be served as a structured knowledge representation scheme, capable of assisting the construction of a personalized learning path. This paper describes the processes of conceptualization and specification, or building of, an ontology. The domain for which the ontology has been constructed is software risk identification. The required concepts, the semantic description of the concepts and the interrelationship among the concepts along with all other ontological components have been collected from various literatures and experience of the people from software industry. From which, a taxonomy has been constructed by using the property 'isA' and the design architecture for the required ontology has also been sketched out manually with nearly four different types of properties. In order to reduce implementation efforts, the Prot\'{e}g\'{e} platform, a scalable and integrated framework for ontological engineering, has been used to construct the ontology. The constructed ontology has been represented in owl format, which makes it more machine understandable. Then the semantic representation of the knowledge has been made using the OWL document generator, which automatically generates a set of documents from the ontology. In order to understand the knowledge in more detailed way again the ontology has been visualized using ontoviz tool.
12695;Why Web 2.0 is Good for Learning and for Research: Principles and Prototypes;"The term ""Web 2.0"" is used to describe applications that distinguish themselves from previous generations of software by a number of principles. Existing work shows that Web 2.0 applications can be successfully exploited for technology-enhance learning. However, in-depth analyses of the relationship between Web 2.0 technology on the one hand and teaching and learning on the other hand are still rare. In this article, we will analyze the technological principles of the Web 2.0 and describe their pedagogical implications on learning. We will furthermore show that Web 2.0 is not only well suited for learning but also for research on learning: the wealth of services that is available and their openness regarding API and data allow to assemble prototypes of technology-supported learning applications in amazingly small amount of time. These prototypes can be used to evaluate research hypotheses quickly. We will present two example prototypes and discuss the lessons we learned from building and using these prototypes."
12705;An Ontology-Based Information Model for Multi-Domain Semantic Modeling and Analysis of Smart City Data;Smart city services are typically defined according to domains (e.g., health, education, safety) and supported by different systems. Consequently, the analysis of smart city data is often domain-specific, thus limiting the capabilities of the offered services and hampering decision-making that relies on isolated domain information. To support a suitable analysis across multiple domains, it is necessary having a unified data model able to handle the inherent heterogeneity of smart city data and take into account both geographic and citizen information. This paper presents an ontology-based information model to support multi-domain analysis in smart cities to foster interoperability and powerful automated reasoning upon unambiguous information. The proposed information model follows Linked Data principles and takes advantage of ontologies to define information semantically. The semantic relationships and properties defined in the model also allow inferring new pieces of information that improve accuracy when analyzing multiple city domains. This paper reports an evaluation of the information model through ontological metrics and competence questions.
12715;Validation of Informal Learning;In this paper, we describe our PhD research proposal for the Education in the Knowledge Society program of the University of Salamanca. Our research centers on defining a framework for structuring and validating an individual's informal learning in order to be able to represent the competences gained through informal means, alongside their formal curriculum.
12728;SeeQuery: An Automatic Method for Recommending Translations of Ontology Competency Questions into SPARQL-OWL;Ontology authoring is a complicated and error-prone process since the knowledge being modeled is expressed using logic-based formalisms, in which logical consequences of the knowledge have to be foreseen. To make that process easier, competency questions (CQs), being questions expressed in natural language are often stated to trace both the correctness and completeness of the ontology at a given time. However, CQs have to be translated into a formal language, like ontology query language (SPARQL-OWL), to query the ontology. Since the translation step is time-consuming and requires familiarity with the query language used, in this paper, we propose an automatic method named SeeQuery, which recommends SPARQL-OWL queries being translations of CQs stated against a given ontology. It consists of a pipeline of transformations based on template matching and filling, being motivated by the biggest to date publicly available CQ to SPARQL-OWL datasets. We provide a detailed description of SeeQuery and evaluate the method on a separate set of 2 ontologies with their CQs. It is, to date, the only automatic method available for recommending SPARQL-OWL queries out of CQs. The source code of SeeQuery is available at: https://github.com/dwisniewski/SeeQuery.
12730;Ontology-Based Framework For Automatic Generation Of SQL Assessment;Assessment measures learner progresses in acquisition of knowledge and skills. It helps teachers to refine their teaching strategies and better deliver knowledge and skills. Likewise, It makes it possible not only to simulate learners’ thinking but to measure the value or quality of their work. Creating effective assessment of learning is a difficult task for teachers. This article presents an automatic question generating system for individual assessment of learners’ practical knowledge.
12736;Towards an Automatic Approach for Assessing Program Competencies;Skills analysis is an interdisciplinary area that studies labor market trends and provides recommendations for developing educational standards and re-skilling efforts. We leverage techniques in this area to develop a scalable approach that identifies and evaluates educational competencies. In this work, we developed a skills extraction algorithm that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques. We evaluated our algorithm on a labeled dataset and found its performance to be competitive with state-of-the-art methods. Using this algorithm, we analyzed student skills, university course syllabi, and online job postings. Our cross-sector analysis provides an initial landscape of skill needs for specific job titles. Additionally, we conducted a within-sector analysis based on programming jobs, computer science curriculum, and undergraduate students. Our findings suggest that students have a variety of hard skills and soft skills, but they are not necessarily the ones that employers want. The data also suggests these courses teach skills that are somewhat different from industry needs, and there is a lack of emphasis on soft skills. These results provide an initial assessment of the program competencies for a computer science program. Future work includes more data gathering, improving the algorithm, and applying our method to assess additional educational programs.
12742;Ontology-Guided Job Market Demand Analysis: A Cross-Sectional Study for the Data Science Field;The rapid changes in the job market, including a continuous year-on-year increase in new skills in sectors like information technology, has resulted in new challenges for job seekers and educators alike. The former feel less informed about which skills they should acquire to raise their competitiveness, whereas the latter are inadequately prepared to offer courses that meet the expectations by fast-evolving sectors like data science. In this paper, we describe efforts to obtain job demand data and employ a information extraction method guided by a purposely-designed vocabulary to identify skills requested by the job vacancies. The Ontology-based Information Extraction (OBIE) method employed relies on the Skills and Recruitment Ontology (SARO), which we developed to represent job postings in the context of skills and competencies needed to fill a job role. Skill demand by employers is then abstracted using co-word analysis based on a set of skill keywords and their co-occurrences in the job posts. This method reveals the technical skills in demand together with their structure for revealing significant linkages. In an evaluation, the performance of the OBIE method for automatic skill annotation is estimated (strict F-measure) at 79%, which is satisfactory given that human inter-annotator agreement was found to be automatic keyword indexing with an overall strict F-measure at 94%. In a secondary study, sample skill maps generated from the matrix of co-occurrences and correlation are presented and discussed as proof-of-concept, highlighting the potential of using the extracted OBIE data for more advanced analysis that we plan as future work, including time series analysis.
12752;Using Ontologies to Aid Knowledge Sharing in HCI Design;Developing interactive systems is a challenging task that involves concerns related to the human-computer interaction (HCI), such as usability and user experience. Therefore, HCI design is a core issue when developing such systems. It often involves people with different backgrounds (e.g., Arts, Software Engineering, Design), which makes knowledge transfer a challenging issue. Ontologies have been acknowledged as a successful approach to represent domain knowledge and support knowledge-based solutions. Hence, in this work, we propose to explore ontologies to represent structured knowledge and improve knowledge sharing in HCI design. We briefly present the Human-Computer Interaction Design Ontology (HCIDO), a reference ontology that addresses HCI design aspects that connect HCI and Software Engineering concerns. By making knowledge related to the HCI design domain explicit and structured, HCIDO has helped us to develop KTID, a tool that aims to support capturing and sharing useful knowledge to aid in HCI design. Preliminary results indicate that the tool may be particularly useful for novice HCI designers.
12756;Review of Challenges in Content Extraction in Web Based Personalized Learning Content Management Systems;A preliminary work in support of our research in developing ontology driven LO extraction analyzes some of the existing Learning Content Management Systems (LCMS) with emphasis on Architecture and Design Issues. Learning Object Repositories (LOR) have great impact on retrieval and storage of contents, so performance improvement issues via content aggregation in LORs have been studied in this paper. The paper discusses the challenges that are being faced by Web-Based LCMS with regards to content extraction.
12764;Computer Science/Informatics in Secondary Education;Computer Science (CS) Education research, specifically when focusing on secondary education, faces the difficulty of regionally differing political, legal, or curricular constraints. To date, many different studies exist that document the specific regional situations of teaching CS in secondary schools. This ITiCSE working group report documents the process of collecting, evaluating, and integrating research findings about CS in secondary schools from different countries. As an outcome, it presents a category system (Darmstadt Model), as a first step towards a framework that sup-ports future research activities in this field and that supports the transfer of results between researchers and teachers in CS education (CSE) across regional or national boundaries. Exemplary application of the Darmstadt model shows in several important categories how different the situation of CSE in secondary education in various countries can be. The Darmstadt Model (DM) is now ready for discussion and suggestions for improvement by the CSE-community.
12766;Characterising the Gap Between Theory and Practice of Ontology Reuse;"Ontology reuse is a complex process that requires the support of methodologies and tools to minimise errors and to keep the ontologies consistent and coherent. Although the vast majority of ontology engineering methodologies include a reuse phase, and reuse has been investigated for different tasks and purposes (e.g.ontology integration), this body of work does not seem to translate into practice, neither in the form of strict criteria for reuse, nor as a set of community proposed guidelines. In this paper, we report the salient results from a study aimed at ontology developers and practitioners, whose objective is to gain an insight into the gap between the theory and the practice of ontology reuse. Thefocus of our study is to gain practitioners' views on i) their preferred reuse approaches; ii) the types of ontologies they tend to reuse (e.g. specific domain ontologies or upper-level ontologies)iii) what reporting information they deem useful when deciding which ontology to reuse; iv) what are the main reasons deterring them from reusing an ontology. Our findings confirm and extend established results from the literature, but in addition, the study provides a fresh view on the practice of reuse with an explicit focus on highly experienced developers and moderately experienced ones. The study corroborates the need for a comprehensive set of recommendations, that are widely accepted by the community, and are possibly implemented in development tools."
12768;Ontology Evaluation and Multilingualism;Many ontologies have been developed recently, and evaluation is important for researchers or users when searching ontologies needed in their work. Ontology evaluation also is important phase of ontology development, refinement or evolution process. Automatically-developed ontologies as a result of ontology learning also need from evaluation. So, ontology evaluation is important both for selecting ontologies, meeting some requirements, and as a part of ontology life cycle. In this paper we propose deep analysis of ontology evaluation and discuss how multilingualism affects ontology evaluation. We classify ontology evaluation approaches, methods and metrics according to several dimensions. Our analysis and conclusions will be helpful for development of good ontologies and for finding or selection of needed ontologies.
12785;Can Technology Replace the Teachers’ Role in Higher Education Settings? A Systematic Literature Review;As technologies continue to advance and become more complex, they will have significant ramifications for formal education contexts. It is mentioned that digital technologies will remain in our virtual and physical classrooms for the foreseeable future. Moreover, when it comes to the direct contact between students and their teachers, it is challenging to simulate a teacher’s ability to read and respond to students’ emotions. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to obtain data from a variety of sources to determine whether technology can replace teachers using PRISMA Protocol as the research methodology with 39 previous studies from the SCOPUS journal. According to the findings of this study, it can be concluded that technology cannot replace the rules and positions of teachers, particularly when it comes to psychological and value issues, because ICTs cannot make every potential decision about other people.
12792;Software Product Line to Overcome the Variability Issue in E-Learning: Systematic Literature Review;"The disparity of educational technologies, pedagogies and learning styles implies a problem of variability when modeling E-learning systems. Furthermore, the current learning context, which has become very open and heterogeneous, raises the problem of automating the modeling, development and maintenance of personalized E-learning systems based on various pedagogies. For its part, the ""Software Product Line"" is a paradigm that aims to produce product families based on the principles of reuse, configuration and derivation. The main purpose of this literature review is to explore the different potential applications of ""SPL"" in the E-learning domain to figure out the problem of variability. We will adopt a protocol for a systematic review of literature, after which we will draw up an analysis report."
12799;Using TOSCA Language to Model Personalized Educational Content: Introducing EduTOSCA;Students attending Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) of Vocational Educational and Training (VET) are faced with a variety of complex decisions and procedures. To provide students with more sustained and personalized advising, many HEIs/VETs use academic advising systems and tools as a way to minimize costs and streamline their advising services. Furthermore, it is quite common for educational programs to include and combine educational content from different educational providers, while they are managed and executed on different platforms. Therefore, the ability to develop conceptual models for personalized learning based on educational content produced by heterogeneous educational service providers is a pressing need to address. A similar issue is confronted when deploying applications across diverse cloud computing platforms. A solution that is provided in these situations is the development of specialized languages for defining the topology and the orchestration of applications such as TOSCA, CAMP, Open-CSA, etc. In this paper, we propose to use similar conceptual models for modelling heterogeneous educational offerings toward personalized learning, which are presented along with the overall architecture of a system, named cc-coach, able to support these concepts. Further, this paper is a proposal for the standardization efforts needed for creating a multi-vendor educational ecosystem with diverse stakeholders, able to support personalized learning at various levels.
12800;On Gamification in Action Learning;"The advent of globalisation brought about by advances in information and communication technology has triggered major changes in the way people work, live and study. The modern teaching endeavour must meet the needs of a fundamentally changing learning environment and student cohorts, while preserving delivered knowledge quality in order to meet the required learning objectives. Flexible teaching (distance/online, intensive mode, afternoon classes etc.), online resources and tools, teachers with industry experience and especially new teaching models matching the new cohorts profile requirements can provide a solid platform for a new paradigm in the higher education domain.This research has investigated how a customised application of 'gamification' (taking game-based elements and applying them in non-gaming contexts) to higher education can improve the learning and teaching experience and student engagement and thus help towards reducing student attrition. Gamification of the educational endeavour has been studied in the past; however, in this study it is applied within a novel iterative and combined Action Research, Experiential Action Learning, Plan, Implement, Review, Improve and Plan, Do, Study, Act approach that attempts to make contributions to both learning and teaching theory and practice."
12801;Automatic Extraction of Core Learning Goals and Generation of Pedagogical Sequences through a Collection of Digital Library Resources;"A key challenge facing educational technology researchers is how to provide structure and guidance when learners use unstructured and open tools such as digital libraries for their own learning. This work attempts to use computational methods to identify that structure in a domain independent way and support learners as they navigate and interpret the information they find. This article highlights a computational methodology for generating a pedagogical sequence through core learning goals extracted from a collection of resources which in this case, are resources from the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE). This article describes how we use the technique of multi-document summarization to extract the core learning goals from the digital library resources and how we create a supervised classifier that performs a pair-wise classification of the core learning goals; the judgments from these classifications are used to automatically generate pedagogical sequences. Results show that we can extract good core learning goals and make pair-wise classifications that are up to 76% similar to the pair-wise classifications generated from pedagogical sequences created by two science education experts. Thus we can dynamically generate pedagogically meaningful learning paths through digital library resources."
12808;Design Insights for the next Wave Ontology Authoring Tools;Ontologies have been employed across scientific and business domains for some time, and the proliferation of linked data means the number and range of potential authors is set to increase significantly. Ontologies using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) are complex artefacts, however: the authoring process requires not only knowledge of the application domain, but also skills in programming and logics. To date, there has been no systematic attempt to understand the effectiveness of existing tools, or explore what users really require to build successful ontologies. Here we address this shortfall, presenting insights from an interview study with 15 ontology authors. We identify the problems reported by authors, and the strategies they employ to solve them. We map the data to a set of design recommendations, which describe how tools of the future can support ontology authoring. A key challenge is dealing with information overload: improving the user's ability to navigate, populate and debug large ontologies will revolutionise the engineering process, and open ontology authoring up to a new generation of users.
12831;A Researcher Expertise Search System Using Ontology-Based Data Mining;This paper proposes an approach to discover the expertise of researchers using data mining with skill classification ontology. The skill classification ontology is an information model containing skills of doing research in the area of computer and information science. A methodology to build the ontology is presented. The expertise search system is developed, which uses the skill classification ontology, researcher profiles and research profiles in the retrieving process. These profiles and ontology are expressed by OWL. Also, the matching and ranking processes are proposed and these follow semantic-based matching. We explored the evaluation of the retrieving process and the result shows that the proposed approach enables the expertise search system to be efficient regarding accuracy.
12833;Transformation of the Pedagogical Process in the Context of Digital Education;"The pedagogical thought of the twenty-first century addresses the pressing issues of education. The article presents an analysis of the development of the ideas in the didactic theory of general education. The purpose of the study is to analyze the current state of the education system in Russia and to present the impact of a certain historical period on the social, cultural, and scientific attitudes of school education. The scientific novelty of the study is our classification of the content of education: classical - non-classical-post-non-classical. New approaches to the organization of the pedagogical process and the education of the cultural type of personality in it are identified. This indicates the need for the development of modern human competencies in the field of communication, the development and processing of information, and social actions. As a result of our research, we were able to identify the following. A new target for school education is being formed. It is important to form knowledge that adequate to the current level of the scientific picture of the world; to develop constructive cognitive abilities; to contribute to the development of moral values and personal meanings. The trend in understanding the content of school education and its pedagogical process is determined: from the ""transfer of the basics of science"" in the aspect of classical concepts to the personal development of the student. Thus, all these changes are now considered as social and cultural challenges to modern education, didactics as a theory and school teaching as a practice, which are designed to provide an answer based on both the traditions of Russian education and innovations."
12838;Using Formal Concept Analysis for Ontology Maintenance in Human Resource Recruitment;Ontologies have been proven useful for many applications by enabling semantic search and reasoning. Human resource management has recently attracted interest by researchers and practitioners seeking to exploit ontologies for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the job recruitment process. However, the quality of semantic search and decision making intimately depends on the quality of the ontology used. Most current efforts concentrate on the development of general ontologies that find wide approval by the HR community worldwide. In order to be useful for automatic matchmaking between job offers and job seekers, such high-level ontologies need to be adequately enriched with detailed domain-specific knowledge and adapted to the particular needs of individual job markets. We present an approach for enriching and adapting an existing ontology using formal concept analysis.
12843;Mixed Methods: Lessons Learned from Five Cases of Doctoral Theses;The use of the so-called mixed methods has had a significant growth in educational research throughout the present century. The combined use of both quantitative and qualitative methods, based on certain epistemological assumptions, aims to understand in a more holistic way various educational phenomena. The purpose of this paper is to present a reflection on the lessons learned that the author synthesizes from his work as an adviser of five doctoral theses using these methods. The results highlight five lessons learned about methodological references, philosophical foundations, methodological variations, precision of terms, and students' training.
12854;Topic Maps as a Tool for Facilitating Collaborative Work Pedagogy in Knowledge Management Systems;The utilization of digital knowledge management systems (KMS) to improve learning is a conventional trend in modern day computer science. These systems facilitate knowledge creation, sharing, and implementation of various pedagogical approaches including collaboration tasks. In situations where traditional learning scenarios are not possible, collaborative tools and platforms are used for providing immersive learning experiences. As it is known, collaboration has become a core competency of modern education, and an indispensable tool employed in the information technology sector. There exist different forms of knowledge management systems with different architecture. This leads to one system facilitating one form of pedagogy over the other. On the one hand, collaborative pedagogical approaches in digital learning can aid knowledge sharing, question asking, with which a feedback is expected without time and space constraints. Certain mechanisms in some KMS architectures such as Topic Maps emphasizes on the findalibility of information, which in turn could promote collaborative pedagogy. This paper discusses the development of a collaborative knowledge blog with some topic map implementation. It investigates the role of digital collaborative learning in scientific knowledge acquisition. We assessed students’ ease of learning and analyzed their engagement while utilizing the system. Results indicate that the students showed deeper engagement and improved in their scientific understanding over time which reinforces the importance of collaborative activities as observed in literature.
12856;A Snapshot of Ontology Evaluation Criteria and Strategies;"Ontologies are key to information retrieval, semantic integration of datasets, and semantic similarity analyses. Evaluating ontologies (especially defining what constitutes a ""good"" or ""better"" ontology) is therefore of central importance for the Semantic Web community. Various criteria have been introduced in the literature to evaluate ontologies, and this article classifies them according to their relevance to the design or the implementation phase of ontology development. In addition, the article compiles strategies for ontology evaluation based on ontologies published until 2017 in two outlets: the Semantic Web Journal, and the Journal of Web Semantics. Gaps and opportunities for future research on ontology evaluation are exposed towards the end of the paper."
12867;Student Profile Modeling: An Overview Model;"Today, provide a customized, personalized and adaptive service is a big challenge that improve the services and functionalities of systems. The knowledge of the user profile is a vital phase in this process. Profile modeling is an important field that aims to give an abstract representation of some aspects related to the user features. In the educational field, student profile modeling can be a support for decision-making at different levels like learning, orientation, and recommendation. It can mainly offer the most exact description of students in order to: be able to act in case of problems such as failure, drop out; offer students the most appropriate orientation and recommendation; and define the most adaptive learning resources depending on their profile. In this paper, we present an analytical and statistical study on student profile modeling to propose a detailed description of the student's profile obtained with different techniques in different contexts of the educational field. We aim to extract the different categories of student's features that can be used alone or combined for decision making in different fields."
12868;Attitude towards the Use of Mobile Devices for the Practice of Oral Skills in English;In this paper, we describe a project carried out to get information about the use and expectations of students towards mobile apps as educational resources. We focus our research on the leading role that Communication and Information Technologies have recently achieved as devices to assist the learning processes, and, more specifically, as elements to enhance an ubiquitous and lifelong learning of languages at tertiary level. To obtain relevant data on mobile devices as English learning resources, we have carried out a survey among university students and analyzed the results obtained, to create a realistic and updated panorama that will serve as a basis for future research.
12874;Semantic Web Based Software Platform for Curriculum Harmonization;This paper presents a software platform for comparing informatics teacher education curricula. The ontological model of the chosen informatics teachers' curriculum from the Republic of Serbia and the reference informatics teachers' curriculum model were created. The semi-automatic software platform is based on the standard techniques and methods of ontology matching. The created ontological models of the teacher education curricula are compared using the developed software. Analysis of the results of comparison includes consideration of classes' matching, obtained system evaluation (by the expert team) and a harmonization of the Revised Bloom's taxonomy categories. Also, the obtained results are compared with the results obtained for other combinations of input ontological models (secondary informatics and informatics teacher education curricula models). The analysis of the results revealed the need to improve the content and structure of the observed model curricula as well as the limits of the developed system and possibilities of improving the software platform.
12879;Uncovering Structure behind Function: The Experiment as Teaching Method in Computer Science Education;There are lots of reports about activities that aim at fostering and maintaining interest in computing. These activities rely on different ideas that should help to involve novices and young learners. In this article examples are given and explained from a discipline-specific perspective based on the notion of a dual nature of digital artifacts, which has to be reconstructed and integrated during the process of computer science education. The claim is that learners either focus on the internal computational properties: the structure, or on the more external reasons to use them: the function -- but rarely are able to develop an integrated perspective on both sides. Therefore learning experiences should be designed to bridge these perspectives and enable to perceive the dual nature of digital artifacts. This idea of bridges between structure and function is used to design and analyze learning activities with regard to their potential in fostering and maintaining interest in computer science, especially to those not already interested. This article presents and discusses three examples for such experiments. Based on this, guidelines for experiments as teaching method, and questions for further research are derived.
12882;STAFFER: Skill Training Alliance for the Future European Rail System✱;Rail is becoming the backbone of the European sustainable smart mobility. Nevertheless, Europe is experiencing a severe staff shortage for a rapidly developing but increasingly aging sector. In order to meet the rail development trends and to rejuvenate human resources, the STAFFER project aims to identify current and future skills requirements, and to support educational and training establishments in their efforts of curricula adaptation, and mobility programmes implementation. This paper presents the current achievements of the project namely, the identification of skills and competence needs from the perspectives of both operators and suppliers, the development of mobility and training programmes, and their validation for effectively increasing employability and career opportunities.
12885;From Theory Bias to Theory Dialogue: Embracing Cognitive, Situated, and Critical Framings of Computational Thinking in K-12 CS Education;"The increased interest in promoting CS education for all has been coalescing around the idea of ""computational thinking."" Several framings for promoting computational thinking in K-12 education have been proposed by practitioners and researchers that each place different emphases on either (1) skill and competence building, (2) creative expression and participation, or (3) social justice and ethics. We review each framing and how the framings structure the theory space of computational thinking. We then discuss how CS education can leverage the explanatory potential that each framing offers to the implementation and evaluation of learning, teaching, and tools in computing education. Our goal is to help CS education researchers, teachers, and designers unpack and leverage the complexities of this theory space (rather than ignoring it) while also addressing broader educational concerns regarding diversity, providing new directions for how students and teachers can actively participate in designing their digital futures, and directing current computing education efforts towards a more humanistic orientation."
12891;Artificial Intelligence Competencies for Data Science Undergraduate Curricula;In August 2017, the ACM Education Council initiated a task force to add to the broad, interdisciplinary conversation on data science, with an articulation of the role of computing discipline-specific contributions to this emerging field. Specifically, the task force is seeking to define what the computing contributions are to this new field, in order to provide guidance for computer science or similar departments offering data science programs of study at the undergraduate level. The ACM Data Science Task Force has completed the initial draft of a curricular report. The computing-knowledge areas identified in the report are drawn from across computing disciplines and include several sub-areas of AI. This short paper describes the overall project, highlights AI-relevant areas, and seeks to open a dialog about the AI competencies that are to be considered central to a data science undergraduate curriculum.
12896;Identifying Unreliable Sources of Skill and Competency Information;Organizations need to accurately understand the skills and competencies of their human resources in order to effectively respond to internal and external demands for expertise and make informed hiring decisions. In recent years, however, human resources have become highly mobile, making it more difficult for organizations to accurately learn their competencies. In such environment, organizations need to rely significantly on third parties to provide them with useful information about individuals. These sources and the information they provide, however, vary in degrees of trust and validity. In a previous paper, we developed an ontology for skills and competencies and modeled and analyzed the various sources of information used to derive the belief in an individual's level of competency. In this paper, we present an approach based on social network analysis for identifying unreliable sources of competency information. We explore the conditions under which evaluations given by an individual or a group about another can be trusted. We evaluate this approach using recommendation data gathered by crawling user profiles in LinkedIn.
12898;A Context Based Approach to Adapt Training Strategy for Handicraft Women from Third World Countries;Teaching strategies using social constructivism as a referent include teaching in contexts that might be personally meaningful to students, negotiating taken-as-shared meanings with students, class discussion, small-group collaboration, and valuing meaningful activity over correct answers. Emphasis is growing on the teacher's use of multiple epistemologies, to maintain dialectic tension between teacher guidance and student-initiated exploration, as well as between social learning and individual learning. Social context and culture can impede training strategy. We are involved in a research project studying the manner handicraft women of third world or emergent countries use new technologies. We aim to train women to help them developing their business and creativity. We propose a specific manner to train women taking into social and cultural aspects. Then we define an ontology-based implementation to support the training approach. This research work is based on a concrete implementation.
12902;Bringing Computational Thinking to K-12: What is Involved and What is the Role of the Computer Science Education Community?;The process of increasing student exposure to computational thinking in K-12 is complex, requiring systemic change, teacher engagement, and development of signifi cant resources. Collaboration with the computer science education community is vital to this effort.
12912;LONET: An Interactive Search Network for Intelligent Lecture Path Generation;Sharing resources and information on the Internet has become an important activity for education. In distance learning, instructors can benefit from resources, also known as Learning Objects (LOs), to create plenteous materials for specific learning purposes. Our repository (called the MINE Registry) has been developed for storing and sharing learning objects, around 22,000 in total, in the past few years. To enhance reusability, one significant concept named Reusability Tree was implemented to trace the process of changes. Also, weighting and ranking metrics have been proposed to enhance the searchability in the repository. Following the successful implementation, this study goes further to investigate the relationships between LOs from a perspective of social networks. The LONET (Learning Object Network), as an extension of Reusability Tree, is newly proposed and constructed to clarify the vague reuse scenario in the past, and to summarize collaborative intelligence through past interactive usage experiences. We define a social structure in our repository based on past usage experiences from instructors, by proposing a set of metrics to evaluate the interdependency such as prerequisites and references. The structure identifies usage experiences and can be graphed in terms of implicit and explicit relations among learning objects. As a practical contribution, an adaptive algorithm is proposed to mine the social structure in our repository. The algorithm generates adaptive routes, based on past usage experiences, by computing possible interactive input, such as search criteria and feedback from instructors, and assists them in generating specific lectures.
12913;Web Documents Structures as Source for Machine-Understandable Document;"The web documents are not understandable by computers. And, web documents cross the web hold nourmance amount of information. To gain the maximum precision of reaching precise results, understanding these web documents is vital task. Moreover, it has always been the case that the Semantic Web is an extension of the current web. The Semantic Web or Web 3.0 is a collection of components that work together so that a machine is able to process and understand information. In order for this vision to be realized, formal standards for representing and interpreting data must be formulated and imposed. These formal standards include machine understandable ontologies Ontology Web Language (OWL). The Semantic Web vision provides the current Web with necessary infrastructure that allows computer to process knowledge and one of the cornerstones of this infrastructure is the Ontology. As this survey focuses on ""web documents"" as source for machine-understable document, we will discuss it in details how the researchers dealt with these web documents in order to build ontology."
12918;"Educating the Workforce: M&amp;S Professional Education";"As Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) becomes increasingly important, there is a significant and growing need to educate and train M&amp;S practitioners and researchers. The Department of Defense (DoD) has a growing need for an educated M&amp;S workforce. This need includes users, developers, managers and executive-level personnel, which can effectively apply M&amp;S to DoD requirements. While several universities offer academic M&amp;S degree programs, the time and expense of earning these degrees often limit the number of people that go through these programs. Professional education is an alternative for gaining M&amp;S skills and knowledge, and courses are offered by a range of university and commercial groups. The observations in this paper begin to outline both the need and available options for M&amp;S professional education. This collection of position papers begins a conversation on the DoD's need for professional M&amp;S education and how the M&amp;S Body of Knowledge might fit within that strategy. These position papers are contributed in preparation of a panel discussion and edited for the supporting proceedings."
12919;What We Talk About When We Talk About Programs;Programming plays a paramount role in many educational policies and initiatives. However, the current focus on coding skills poses the risk of giving students an overly simplistic and impoverished idea of what programming means and involves. Their experiences would be much more significant if learning encompassed understanding the richness of the nature of programs. Programs permeate our lives more inextricably than might often be recognised, and all citizens of the digital era could benefit from understanding their multifaceted nature. A fundamental component of such an understanding is getting a sense of how programs are created and work (i.e., the programming process). But programs are strange creatures that escape simple definitions. To the best of our knowledge, there is no Nature of Programs framework that teachers and policy makers can use to shape their practice and targets. In this working group we developed such a framework, by collecting and organising contributions from the literature and the computer science education community. The paper presents the framework and the rationale behind its development. It is anticipated that the framework can be used to inform the design of sound curricula, and support teachers and learners to understand the bigger picture around programming.
12924;Developing Enterprise Architecture Skills in HEI's: A Russian Survey;"Nowadays Bachelor and Master Students in Management usually do not acquire deep knowledges in Information Technologies, Information Systems and Software Development during their curricular if their educational program is not directly related to Business Informatics. However, industrial experience shows that working in innovative companies requires managers being able not only to manage the business processes effectively, but also initiate changes to them in order to keep the companies stay ahead. Today in digital age corporative business processes are supported by Enterprise Information Systems. Therefore the need for hard skills in Information Systems (IS) is relevant for future managers. Another question is how deep these hard skills in IT should be.This paper discusses the results of implementing the course of the Enterprise Architecture (EA) in educational process of Bachelor students in Management with focus on Industrial Management (Field of study 38.03.02. Management, Educational program ""Industrial Management (Energy)"") and focus on Supply Chain Management (Field of study 38.03.02. Management, Educational program ""Logistics and Supply Chain Management""). Archimate, Archi and generally TOGAF methodologies assisted the students in conducting their project work on changes in company IT infrastructure or during the hands-on exercise. The study was carried out at two Russian higher educational institutions (HEI) using the quantitative survey technique and data collection.The simplified framework of EA skills constituting the competency of business stakeholders is presented. General recommendation is that EA course can be effectively included in educational process of Bachelor Students in Management in order to develop EA skills that are significant for future managers and decision makers in digital environment. The results of the study contribute to curriculum choices, teaching methods and learning objectives in current educational process of future managers."
12926;Knowledge Management and Collective Intelligence through Web Tools;In last decade, knowledge management has become a relevant and essential topic in education, in which knowledge is considered an action within an organizational learning model. The purpose of knowledge management is to improve production and results among teachers and students. However, educational institutions are often missing a systematic organization of knowledges in academia due to a lack of strategies or understanding. Many times, knowledge is thought of as tactile (knowledge possessed by one individual), which is why explicit knowledge (shared or socialized knowledge) is overlooked. Given the previous, we utilized a collective of creativity to establish a hypothesis for the Knowledge Management project. We considered a spiral model of knowledge known as SECI (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Internalization). The previous model is meant to fortify collective intelligence among students as they work collaboratively through workshops and technology. Therefore, we will design, implement, and analyze the SECI model. The participants for this study are majoring in the Bachelor of Information and Technology program and are enrolled in the Interdisciplinary and Focus course. Additionally, teachers and students will be diagnosed on knowledge management and the use of information and technology communication tools. The study could be useful in helping students develop collective knowledge in their course and bachelor program.
12929;Document Annotation Tools: Annotation Classification Mechanisms;Document annotation tools have been widely used in technology-enhanced learning. Through these tools, students can associate annotations with fragments of documents, which enhances the thorough analysis of content and develops meta-reflective thinking. Likewise, annotation tools can facilitate collaborative annotation among students, as well as implement innovative interaction mechanisms. In addition, most tools provide mechanisms for classifying annotations. These mechanisms facilitate the subsequent retrieval of relevant annotations. Therefore, classification mechanisms are essential to facilitating the evaluation of work done by students, promoting collaborative work in annotation communities, etc. In addition, classification mechanisms help students better understand what they should annotate, implicitly guiding them during annotation activities. However, while there are multiple studies focusing on other aspects of annotation tools, the classification aspect has deserved only marginal attention in the literature. This work makes an exploratory study focused on this essential, although somewhat ignored, requirement. As a result, five main approaches to annotation classification are identified: absence of classification mechanisms, classification based on annotation modes, classification by predefined semantic categories, classification based on folksonomies, and classification based on ontologies.
12937;The Impact of the Digital Interaction Network on the Future Professionals Behavior;The paper focuses on the social and psychological factors of human-computer interactions in students' preparation for responsible engineering activities. Engineering in a digital society requires computer skills in any professional field. The authors emphasize the need for a systematic analysis of the students' readiness to predict real situations, to make responsible decisions and to evaluate their consequences independently. The study of factors influencing the behavioral deviancy of future specialists is especially important within the framework of applied computer ethics, which emphasizes the potential negative aspects of the interactive virtual environment impact on perception of information while making responsible decisions. The digital and professional competence combination implies the socio-psychological context inclusion in the assessment of the possibility of introducing and future use of technological innovations into network environment, taking into account the consequences that lead to the transformation of mental and behavioral actions. The authors' goals are determined by the analysis of the digital interactions' influence on shaping a prospective readiness of a future specialist for adequate professional activity within complex conditions of the modern info sphere. The empiric study was conducted utilizing focus groups and online survey of a representative sample of the St. Petersburg Polytechnic University students.
12938;Skills Matter: Modeling the Relationship between Decision Making Processes and Collaborative Problem-Solving Skills during Hidden Profile Tasks;Collaborative problem-solving (CPS) is one of the most essential 21st century skills for success across educational and professional settings. The hidden-profile paradigm is one of the most prominent avenues of studying group decision making and underlying issues in information sharing. Previous research on the hidden-profile paradigm has primarily focused on static constructs (e.g., group size, group expertise), or on the information itself (whether certain pieces of information is being shared). In the current study, we propose a lens on individual and group’s collaborative problem-solving skills, to explore the relationships between dynamic discourse processes and decision making in a distributed information environment. Specifically, we sought to examine CPS skills in association with decision change and productive decision-making. Our results suggest that while sharing information has significantly positive association with decision change and effective decision-making, other aspects of social processes appear to be negatively correlated with these outcomes. Cognitive CPS skills, however, exhibit a strong positive relationship with making a (productive) change in students final decisions. We also find that these results are more pronounced at the group level, particularly with cognitive CPS skills. Our study shed lights on a more nuanced picture of how social and cognitive CPS interactions are related to effective information sharing and decision making in collaborative problem-solving interactions.
12943;Constructing Expert Profiles over Time for Skills Management and Expert Finding;"Expert profiling and identification are important to both knowledge workers and organizations. To this end, skills management and expert recommender systems facilitate the management of skills and competencies and help find appropriate experts to meet a particular need. In this paper, we present a technique for generating evolving expert profiles of individuals composed of their skills and competencies using heterogeneous data from divergent sources of information. We use self-declarations, completed learning activities, and previous work experience to generate the initial profile. Recommendations, ""wisdom of the crowd"""", direct observations of online and offline activities, and content generated by the individual both within the organization and on the Web are then used to enrich the profiles and to assess and validate skills and competencies over time."
12949;STOPS: A Graph-Based Study Planning and Curriculum Development Tool;STOPS (Software for Target-Oriented Personal Syllabus) is a tool that allows university students to create personal study plans and the staff to maintain and develop course contents and curriculum structure. In the system, the curriculum is modeled as a graph of learning outcomes. First, the courses are broken down to learning outcomes, i.e. what a student should know after completing a course. Second, prerequisite dependencies are defined between the outcomes. Finally, programmes are defined as goals that students can choose for their studies. Programmes consist of competence outcomes that have prerequisite dependencies from the outcomes of the courses. The resulting graph can be visualized so that students can see how the topics taught in various courses are connected to each other, and what each course contributes to the goals that the student has selected. For curriculum developers, the visualizations can reveal shortcomings such as unnecessary repetition or lacking coverage of topics in the course contents.
12951;A Benchmarking Platform for Analyzing Corpora of Traces: The Recognition of the Users' Involvement in Fields of Competencies;Nowadays more and more organisations use the collaborative environments, such as the social networks, to identify profiles of competencies, which are usually declared by the users themselves. We postulate that the analysis of the computer-supported collaborative activities may provide information about the users' competencies in specific domains. In this research work, we present a trace-based approach for dealing with the issue of the analysis of these activities. Our objective is to lay the foundations of an evaluation system, which is based on the exploitation of sharable digital traces by means of various analysis tools. We expect that the profiles of competencies may be enriched by taking into account the users' activities. We illustrate this research work through a case study: the recognition of users' involvement in a practical course of Java programming activity in order to define different working teams according to competencies of members.
12952;Acquiring Ethical Communicative Tools for an Online Ethics Training;Nowadays, one of the most dynamic areas in applied ethics is professional ethics (e.g. in the areas of medicine, business and engineering). In this paper, we will focus on the online teaching of professional ethics to undergraduate engineering students, mainly in the specialty of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). More specifically, the pedagogical structure for the ethical training of future engineers will be designed, within an online context, based on a set of ethical communicative tools. Besides, our proposal will analyze which technological resources are suitable to develop the appropriate ethical communicative competences required by the engineering students, when confronting moral conflicts in their daily professional exercise.
12973;Towards an Integrated Retrieval System to Semantically Match CVs, Job Descriptions and Curricula;The job market is continuously evolving. The specific occupations, skills, competences and qualifications that people need change over time, as does their description. To deal with this, effective and intelligent communication and information exchange between the job market and the education and training sector is vital. On the other hand, and from the perspective of the individual (job seeker), especially the less privileged there is a need for approaches that combine practical tools with motivation and mentoring support since skill-matching it is not enough, skill-building is also needed. In this context, the current approach follows a bottom-up methodology investigating the problem of formalizing the lifelong learning process in a dynamic and flexible way. On the other hand, this proposal utilizes a parallel top-down approach in applying semantics and standards upon data in order to alleviate the gap among individuals, workplaces and educational contexts for the benefit of all in a transparent way. More specifically, this article reports towards an approach on tackling the complex task of interconnecting job seekers, employers and educational agents in the current European labor market. To perform this task, we implement an end-to-end service to parse resumes, job descriptions and open courses descriptions, retrieve information on the qualifications associated with the aforementioned, and semantically match them. The proposed implementation effectively detects the underlying information associated with those sources, and manages to interlink job seekers’ resumes to occupations and job vacancies, while being able to assign skill deficits to courses provided by educational agents. The performance of our implementation on CVs, job descriptions and course descriptions in English, Greek, Romanian and Bulgarian, indicate that our approach yields results on par with the state-of-the-art, however on a much larger scale: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work that engages with this task on three stakeholders (job seekers, employers, educational agents) and in four European languages.
12997;On the Congruence Between Online Social Content and Future IT Skill Demand;The speed of digital transformation has resulted in new challenges for job seekers to become lifelong learners and to develop new skills faster than before. In this paper, our main objective is to examine how online content can serve as indicators for changes to the Information Technology (IT) industry and its in-demand skills. To study this relationship, we collect Reddit posts to represent social media content and job postings to reflect the IT industry based on which we explore possible correlations between them. Further, we propose a methodology to quantitatively estimate the predictive power of social media content for future in-demand skills. Our results show that the frequency of skill-related conversations on Reddit correlates with the popularity of skills in job posting data. Additionally, our findings indicate that the number of social posts dedicated to a specific skill can be a strong indicator for future job requirements. This is an important finding because identifying what skills the labor force should acquire will assist job seekers to plan their lifelong learning objectives to (a) maximize their employability, (b) continuously update their skills to remain in demand, and (c) be informed and actively engaged in defining knowledge trends, rather than reactively becoming informed of the latest information.
12999;Design of an Analytic Centric MS Degree in Information Sciences and Technologies;In this paper, we present the design, development, and offering of a new Master of Science (MS) curriculum in Information Sciences and Technologies (IST) at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). The new curriculum resulted as we enhanced our original MS curriculum to accommodate to the key technological advances in computing as well as the new demands in IT industry. The new curriculum is featured by its analytic centric foundation that provides students a systematic training in analytical thinking and equips them with a solid skill set to manage and analyze different types of data in scale. A number of concentration tracks are also offered that are build upon the foundation to further advance students' learning and expose them to the state-of-the-art in key computing domains.
13017;Personalized Activity Based ELearning;The aim of personalizing web information systems is to tailor content (media) to the user's personal preferences, goals and context, in turn increasing the reusability of that content. However, most developers are increasingly seeking to apply 'Web as a Platform' based approaches where web-based content is integrated with web services to provide the platform and environment features that were traditionally offered by desktop environments and applications. Therefore, next generation personalized web information systems need to be capable of dynamically personalizing, adapting and integrating web content and web services to create customized experiences for individual users. The goal of the research presented in this paper is to provide innovative techniques and technologies to achieve this. As part of this research, a novel architecture for the generation of Personalized Learning Activities, which highlights both the need for, and the power of combining and personalizing content and services has been developed. The system has been evaluated in the context of a Higher Education use case based on the user's perception of three key elements of the Personalized Learning Activity: the personalization, the usability and the educational benefits.
13040;Filtering Graduate Courses Based on LinkedIn Profiles;People are overloaded with the everyday massive amount of information they consume. There are several options available for choice, from TV shows, books, traffic routes to graduate courses. In this scenario of multiple choices, the manual search and evaluation of all possibilities to make decisions is unfeasible. In the academic context, the HEIs (Higher Education Institutions) offer several graduate courses and, with so many options, students need mechanisms to choose relevant courses to their interest in order to reduce the dropout and financial loss risks. In this article, we propose a recommendation approach that filters graduate courses for students using their LinkedIn professional profiles. Experiments show that features based on competences and activity area are more effective than professional summary and experiences to recommend graduate courses within a content-based approach. In addition, our proposed approach performs recommendations with precision of up to 68.50% in the top-1 recommendation lists, achieving 100% coverage.

13096;Picturing What Others Know: Towards a Dashboard for Interdisciplinarity;"In many complex, multi-faceted, problem-solving situations there is a growing need to pull together various competences and backgrounds, i.e. a need to better balance specialisation and interdisciplinarity. But when scientific backgrounds, skills, references, specialized languages and specialized knowledge are too far apart people involved in an interdisciplinary process face a real communication challenge. Communication is here not the best word -- it minors the challenge. What actors face is the challenge to reach a common understanding of facts and of pictures of facts, in other words to build a common, unambiguous, knowledge space. Not making this effort often results in misunderstandings, and accordingly in delays and inefficiency. At the end of the day, results may turn out as a nice patchwork rather than as new knowledge. In this contribution we show that it can be worth having actors get aware of distances between them, of overlaps and non-overlaps in terms of methods, specialised language, references and concepts. We present a series of short experiments that are an attempt to ""measure"" and then visualize the above mentioned distances, and can act as eye openers for a community."
13193;ACORDAR: A Test Collection for Ad Hoc Content-Based (RDF) Dataset Retrieval;Ad hoc dataset retrieval is a trending topic in IR research. Methods and systems are evolving from metadata-based to content-based ones which exploit the data itself for improving retrieval accuracy but thus far lack a specialized test collection. In this paper, we build and release the first test collection for ad hoc content-based dataset retrieval, where content-oriented dataset queries and content-based relevance judgments are annotated by human experts who are assisted with a dashboard designed specifically for comprehensively and conveniently browsing both the metadata and data of a dataset. We conduct extensive experiments on the test collection to analyze its difficulty and provide insights into the underlying task.
13223;Knowledge Profiles of Employees;"It is widely acknowledged that the knowledge and skills of individuals directly affect the ability of organisations to innovate and to provide quality end-products or services, thus, gaining competitive benefits and higher revenues [1], [2], [3]. However, it is difficult to manage knowledge as it resides in human minds. Many efforts have been made for capturing tacit knowledge of employees and making it available in knowledge management systems, however, the initial failures have resulted in applying more ""soft tools"" (e.g. creativity and group facilitation techniques) and supporting communication and knowledge sharing among employees [12], [13]. Subsequently, for finding expertise in organisations are proposed techniques for visualising knowledge sources (e.g. yellow pages, skills maps, etc.) [4], [12].This paper extends the patterns discussed at VikingPLoP 2014 and EuroPLoP 2015 in the area of Knowledge Management Systems design. Its goal is to present a pattern related to Info-Structure design [8], and more specifically focused on knowledge profiles of employees."
13254;Bridge the Terminology Gap between Recruiters and Candidates: A Multilingual Skills Base Built from Social Media and Linked Data;"A major part of the job offers and candidates profiles are now available online. Leveraging this public data, Multiposting, a subsidiary of SAP, aims at providing in real-time an exhaustive job market analysis through the SmartSearch project. One big issue in this project, and more generally in the e-recruitment and the human resources management, is to extract the skills from the raw texts in order to associate a job or a candidate to its corresponding skills. This paper proposes to generate a multilingual base of skills in a novel bottom-up approach that finds its roots from the terminology used by candidates in professional social networks. The knowledge base is built by leveraging the Linked Open Data project DBpedia, as well as the tags of a Q&amp;A website, StackOverflow. The large-scale experiments on real-world job offers show that the coverage and precision of the skills extraction are higher using this base than existing bases. The system has been implemented in industrial context and is used daily to extract the skills from thousands of documents, leading to advanced statistics as illustrated at the end this paper."
13260;Modeling Play: Re-Casting Expertise in MMOGs;"With the increasing popularity of massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) such as World of Warcraft, EVE Online, and Maple Story, attempts have been made to define and measure player expertise both within and across online games. Apart from nuanced ethnographic accounts of elite players, which are deliberately localized and small-scale, studies of MMOG expertise to date have either deployed one-dimensional variables such time spent playing and in-game titles and accomplishments, or a combination of the these. These approaches risk obscuring a host of complex considerations, such as players' prior experience with the game or genre, their relationships to other players, and the ludic affordances and limitations of specific games. And they are also significantly less sophisticated than the criteria and tools players themselves use to measure expertise.Our study of expertise in online games is guided by Bruno Latour's injunction to ""follow the actors""---which for us in this case meant paying careful attention to how players themselves characterize and pursue `expertise' in the everyday realities of their everyday/everynight MMOG lives. Drawing from a multisite, mixed-methods study of 250 MMOG players in 8 sites (both university laboratory and public LAN events), this paper proposes a model for identifying and assessing expertise that is better able to take into consideration the multiple forms, components and expressions of `expert' game playing that players themselves are guided by. This model divides expertise into four inter-related modalities, each addressing a different set of competencies: investment, skill, discourse, and game knowledge. Reviewing each modality in turn, the paper frames this model as an attempt to preserve the complexity of qualitatively-driven, ethnographic accounts of expertise, mobilized in a quantifiable and measurable way."
13317;Studying Possibilities to Use Several Experts' Maps in the Concept Map Based Knowledge Assessment System;The paper is related to the problem of increasing objectivity of the assessment process of students' concept maps in the concept map based knowledge assessment system. It is proposed to solve the mentioned problem by the use of concept maps of several domain experts. Four different solutions are identified and analysed from the point of view of their feasibility and suitability for the current prototype of the system.
13408;Using Hierarchical Skills for Optimized Task Assignment in Knowledge-Intensive Crowdsourcing;Besides the simple human intelligence tasks such as image labeling, crowdsourcing platforms propose more and more tasks that require very specific skills, especially in participative science projects. In this context, there is a need to reason about the required skills for a task and the set of available skills in the crowd, in order to increase the resulting quality. Most of the existing solutions rely on unstructured tags to model skills (vector of skills). In this paper we propose to finely model tasks and participants using a skill tree, that is a taxonomy of skills equipped with a similarity distance within skills. This model of skills enables to map participants to tasks in a way that exploits the natural hierarchy among the skills. We illustrate the effectiveness of our model and algorithms through extensive experimentation with synthetic and real data sets.
13497;Semantic Work Process Analysis: A Reflexive Stakeholder Articulation Approach;Developers still frequently fail to meet stakeholder needs due to the lack of human-centred work representations. The resulting lack of understanding among technology providers, responsible authorities, management, and staff requires revisiting work process representations. Semantic work analysis based on Concept Mapping and Value Networks Analysis helps eliciting, elaborating, reflecting, and developing essential elements of a currently perceived towards an envisioned work structure. Rather than referring to other stakeholders it pinpoints individual potential in terms of generated services or products. They are assessed as additional tangible or intangible input to other process participants.
23942;Project - Competency Based Approach and the Ontological Model of Knowledge Representation of the Planned Learning;The paper considers the technique of modeling and formation educational components of the planned training of CDIO Syllabus, realized in the form of the educational adaptive environment of engineering education. The following key concepts of the methodology have been accepted: competence models of the stages of the CDIO initiative, the method of project training, syntax for describing the concepts of the domain, models for mapping support concepts in the form of expressions of knowledge and ontological engineering.
23943;MODEL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION WITH THE USE OF THE COMPETENCE-PROJECT APPROACH, ONTOLOGICAL ENGINEERING AND SMART CONTRACTS OF KNOWLEDGE COMPONENTS;"The article presents the results of research related to the use of ontological and design competence approaches for the development of knowledge components and their subsequent use for designing individual trajectories of engineering education. The methodology of engineering education is considered, which, together with the initiative CDIO, the project-competence model and the knowledge display in the form of ontology, can be used as the main tool for modelling the propositional presentation of thought. Within the framework of the ontological approach, a knowledge specification language has been developed, which allows modelling the ontologies of supporting concepts of the semantic context of educational resources and specifying them in the form of knowledge expressions. The introduced formalisms and rules of the language of knowledge specification give the expressions of knowledge the properties of adaptability, extensibility, easement of processing and maintenance, which is important in designing engineering education level programs. This technique was tested on the material of the famous monograph by Hassan Goma “UML. Designing real-time systems, parallel and distributed applications"" for the project ""Banking system of client-server type"" and is used on classes. Expressions of knowledge, together with their interfaces, are knowledge components from which individual learning trajectories are constructed."
23947;Improving Cognitive Decision-Making into Adaptive Educational Systems through a Diagnosis Tool based on the Competency Approach;Adaptive Educational systems (AES) does not necessarily lead to a better learning. Several kinds of research reveal that the problem is due to, on the one hand, the accent is put mainly on the technological tools to the detriment of the pedagogical aspect. On the other hand, there is a lack of the importance given to the assessment which is an integral part of the learning-teaching process and the professional act of primary importance which gives the decisions and the consequences that result from it. In this paper, we propose a solution for the diagnostic evaluation based on competency approach especially on the pedagogy of integration. The proposed solution allows getting information about the available learners’ knowledge level by presenting an assessment based on the common definition given to competencies by the majority of the authors of the domain. İn this context, the assessment process proposed is presented on two steps: the first step, we evaluate resources related to the competence to verify their acquisition degree and to remediate if necessary, the second step will evaluate the capacity of leaner to mobilize those resources in order to apprehend a situation and respond to it in a more or less relevant way. This research aims to present a new vision in the context of the assessment into adaptive educational systems.
23954;Supervisor descriptions of veterinary student performance in the clinical workplace: a qualitative interview study;This qualitative study investigated the qualities of veterinary student performance that inform a supervisor's impression of their competency. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 15 supervisors from different veterinary subdisciplines, to elicit descriptions of excellent, weak and marginal students. Thematic analysis of transcriptions revealed 12 themes, of which engagement was frequently discussed and of stated importance, and trustworthiness was a differentiator of weak and marginal students from excellent students. Other themes were knowledge, application of knowledge, technical and animal handling skills, communication, social interaction, personal functioning, caring for animals, impact, prospects and the difficulty in judging competency. Patterns of association of themes were found, however themes were also used independently in unique combinations for most students described. The findings show the range of abilities, behaviours, attitudes and personal characteristics of students that are considered by supervisors and how these are weighted and balanced. The key contribution of engagement and trustworthiness to the overall impression aligns with research indicating their importance for success in clinical practice, as both contributors to competency and indicators of it. The findings may inform future design and investigation of workplace-based learning and in-training evaluation, as well as conceptions of veterinary competency.
23963;Integration of Competencies in an Ontology-Based Framework Supporting Teachers to Construct Learning Designs in the Domain of Sustainable Energy Education;In previous work, a framework based on three ontologies (content, learning design and sustainable energy domain models) was introduced in order to support teachers to construct learning designs in the field of sustainable energy education. This paper is focusing on the integration of a competency model in the structure of this framework. This model actually interconnects the other three models by establishing connections between learning objects, learners, activities, learning objectives/competencies and knowledge in the sustainable energy domain. It enriches the description of learning resources enabling their search and retrieval via queries based on competency parameters and can also support competency-based reasoning in order for the competency gaps to be filled. The competency model came as an answer to a literature review triggered by some results of a Wizard of Oz experiment along with the aim to integrate into the framework sets of questions supporting learning in sustainable energy domain.
23965;Ontology-Based Smart System to Automate Higher Education Activities;The need for smart e-learning environments is resulting in new challenges for researchers and practitioners to develop intelligent systems that can be used to automate the Higher Education (HE) activities in an intelligent way. Some common examples of such activities are “analyzing, finding, and ranking the right resource to teach a course,? “analyzing and finding the people with common research interests to start joint research projects,? and “using data analytics and machine reasoning techniques for conducting the exams with different levels of complexities.? Ontological reasoning and smart data analytics can play an important role in analyzing and automating these HE activities and processes. In this paper, we present a framework named as Higher Education Activities and Processes Automation Framework (HEAPAF). The HEAPAF framework can be used to identify, extract, process, and produce the semantically enriched data in machine understandable format from different educational resources. We also present the Higher Education Ontology (HEO) that we designed and developed to accommodate the HE data and then to perform analysis and reasoning on it. As a proof of concept, we present a case study on the topic, “analyzing, finding, and ranking the right resources to teach a course,? which can dramatically improve the learning patterns of students in the growing smart educational environment. Finally, we provide the evaluation of our framework as evidence of its competency and consistency in improving academic analytics for educational activities and processes by using machine reasoning.
23971;Valuing Prior Learning: Designing an ICT Artifact to Assess Professional Competences through Text Mining;Purpose: This paper aims to introduce an information and communication technology (ICT) artifact that uses text mining to support the innovative and standardized assessment of professional competences within the validation of prior learning (VPL). Assessment means comparing identified and documented professional competences against a standard or reference point. The designed artifact is evaluated by matching a set of curriculum vitae (CV) scraped from LinkedIn against a comprehensive model of professional competence. Design/methodology/approach: A design science approach informed the development and evaluation of the ICT artifact presented in this paper. Findings: A proof of concept shows that the ICT artifact can support assessors within the validation of prior learning procedure. Rather the output of such an ICT artifact can be used to structure documentation in the validation process. Research limitations/implications: Evaluating the artifact shows that ICT support to assess documented learning outcomes is a promising endeavor but remains a challenge. Further research should work on standardized ways to document professional competences, ICT artifacts capture the semantic content of documents, and refine ontologies of theoretical models of professional competences. Practical implications: Text mining methods to assess professional competences rely on large bodies of textual data, and thus a thoroughly built and large portfolio is necessary as input for this ICT artifact. Originality/value: Following the recent call of European policymakers to develop standardized and ICT-based approaches for the assessment of professional competences, an ICT artifact that supports the automatized assessment of professional competences within the validation of prior learning is designed and evaluated.
23972;PLANNING OF THE KNOWLEDGE CONTENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM USING ONTOLOGICAL ENGINEERING AND DESIGN-COMPETENCE APPROACH;The article considers an innovative method of forming knowledge components of planned training, based on the concepts and mechanisms of ontological engineering, project-oriented learning technology and the graduates competence model. The possibilities of the educational environment are shown, first of all, connected with the traditional formation of knowledge content of the curriculum disciplines second, in the case of using project-oriented learning technology, plan the knowledge trend and form the knowledge content of the profile and basic disciplines of the specialty curriculum, in accordance with the competence models of the CDIO stages and, third, using the project-oriented learning technology and the competence approach, plan the knowledge trend and form the knowledge content of the individual learning trajectory scenario. In this case, knowledge components and smart-contract parameters are used to configure the training scenario. Using the example of the discipline Technologies for developing distributed applications and the project Client-server banking system, the formalisms and concepts of the educational environment related to the formation of knowledge content of this discipline, in accordance with the competence models of the CDIO stages are presented. This method is reflected in the educational environment, made in the form of a web application, and tested in the educational process, at the Department of Computer and software engineering, Turan University.
23974;Informatics in Undergraduate Medical Education: Analysis of Competency Frameworks and Practices Across North America;"With the advent of competency-based medical education, as well as Canadian efforts to include clinical informatics within undergraduate medical education, competency frameworks in the United States have not emphasized the skills associated with clinical informatics pertinent to the broader practice of medicine.By examining the competency frameworks with which undergraduate medical education in clinical informatics has been developed in Canada and the United States, we hypothesized that there is a gap: the lack of a unified competency set and frame for clinical informatics education across North America.We performed directional competency mapping between Canadian and American graduate clinical informatics competencies and general graduate medical education competencies. Directional competency mapping was performed between Canadian roles and American common program requirements using keyword matching at the subcompetency and enabling competency levels. In addition, for general graduate medical education competencies, the Physician Competency Reference Set developed for the Liaison Committee on Medical Education was used as a direct means of computing the ontological overlap between competency frameworks.Upon mapping Canadian roles to American competencies via both undergraduate and graduate medical education competency frameworks, the difference in focus between the 2 countries can be thematically described as a difference between the concepts of clinical and management reasoning.We suggest that the development or deployment of informatics competencies in undergraduate medical education should focus on 3 items: the teaching of diagnostic reasoning, such that the information tasks that comprise both clinical and management reasoning can be discussed; precision medical education, where informatics can provide for more fine-grained evaluation; and assessment methods to support traditional pedagogical efforts (both at the bedside and beyond). Assessment using cases or structured assessments (eg, Objective Structured Clinical Examinations) would help students draw parallels between clinical informatics and fundamental clinical subjects and would better emphasize the cognitive techniques taught through informatics."
23996;Modeling as Scientific Reasoning The Role of Abductive Reasoning for Modeling Competence;While the hypothetico-deductive approach, which includes inductive and deductive reasoning, is largely recognized in scientific reasoning, there is not much focus on abductive reasoning. Abductive reasoning describes the theory-based attempt of explaining a phenomenon by a cause. By integrating abductive reasoning into a framework for modeling competence, we strengthen the idea of modeling being a key practice of science. The framework for modeling competence theoretically describes competence levels structuring the modeling process into model construction and model application. The aim of this theoretical paper is to extend the framework for modeling competence by including abductive reasoning, with impact on the whole modeling process. Abductive reasoning can be understood as knowledge expanding in the process of model construction. In combination with deductive reasoning in model application, such inferences might enrich modeling processes. Abductive reasoning to explain a phenomenon from the best fitting guess is important for model construction and may foster the deduction of hypotheses from the model and further testing them empirically. Recent studies and examples of learners’ performance in modeling processes support abductive reasoning being a part of modeling competence within scientific reasoning. The extended framework can be used for teaching and learning to foster scientific reasoning competences within modeling processes.
23999;Ontological approach in the practice of the educational activity: paths formation of individual professional development of students;"Goal.The goal of the work is to develop the improved ontological model of the competency-oriented curricula, allowing constructing individual professional development paths of the students of particular educational profiles. Actuality of the developed model lies in the fact that the competence structure, existing in the framework of competency-oriented curricula, provided by the current Federal state educational standards does not allow differentiating within the same profile of learning the paths of individual professional development of the student, oriented to various career development directions within the general vocational orientation profile.Materials and methods. Individual educational paths can be differentiated according to the choice of the elective disciplines (as common to all profiles within the educational program, and profile). According to the educational standards, the student during the period of study on the educational program must acquire the entire cultural, professional and profile competences (in case of several profiles, existing in the structure of the educational program), provided in the educational plan. Respectively, the elective disciplines between which the students are allowed to choose can be characterized in the plan by one set of competences. Thus, for the construction of the students’ individual professional paths there is the need to differentiate these disciplines.To develop the tools for reaching this goal, the ontological model of the competence-oriented curriculum is constructed, and the algorithm of forming the competences, “complementary? to the competences of the curriculum is suggested. Practical application of the tools is illustrated by developing the “complementary? competences of a specific profile of education (“information management?) of the basic educational program (Bachelor in Management) of 2017 admission year in one of the leading Russian universities.Results.The main methodological result of the work is the suggested algorithm of “complementary? competences formation. The algorithm includes the following steps:1. Analysis of the existing competences of the curriculum;2. Figuring out the criteria of decomposition of the existing competences of the plan and sources of formation of the “complementary? competences;3. Formation of the “complementary? competences, allowing differentiation between the professional and profile elective disciplines;4. Mapping the formed “complementary? competences with the elective disciplines, allowing constructing the individual professional development paths.Practical approbation of the developed algorithm shows its applicability for reaching the designated objectives. Based on the formed algorithm the improved ontological model of the competence-oriented curriculum has been developed, including external sources of the “complementary? competences.Conclusion.The developed tools of differentiating between the elective disciplines of the competence-oriented curriculum have several directions of potential practical applicability. Firstly, students can use these tools for the individual professional development paths’ formation. Secondly, management of the educational programs could use these tools for upgrading the competence-based curricula. Namely, the suggested tools allow increasing logical and systemic self-consistency of the curricula without fundamentally altering their structure; in addition, the tools enable timely correction of curriculum content in accordance with changes in the needs of current and potential employers of the relevant sectors of the economy."
24005;ELO-Tool: Taking Action in the Challenge of Assembling Learning Objects;Nowadays, a wide range of initiatives are focused on providing solutions relating to the integration and reuse of different types of learning objects. This paper deals with the assembly of learning objects, one of the most difficult components for reuse. Our proposal takes into account the requirements and competencies defined for each learning object in order to allow them to be assembled in a coherent way. As a result of this approach, we have developedELO-Tool, a web application that implements an assembly mechanism based on a semantic comparison of requirements and competencies through the use of ontologies. Moreover, the application generates the appropriate set of meta-data to describe the new learning objects resulting from the assembly process.
24008;Ontology of Bio-Medical Educational Objectives (OBEO): ein Vorschlag für eine Ontologie medizinischer Lernziele / A proposal for an Ontology of Bio-Medical Educational Objectives (OBEO);Objectives: The Ontology of Bio-Medical Educational Objectives (OBEO) is a formal ontology for the annotation of educational objective catalogues and learning object resources to improve their usability. OBEO has been designed to allow semantic retrieval and navigation of educational objectives as well as the solution of questions in regard to consistency, sequence and correctness of educational objectives in databases. Methods: To specify OBEO various educational objective taxonomies and catalogues were analyzed and a requirements analysis was performed. OBEO was developed on the foundation of the top-level ontology Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE) and the upper-level ontology BioTop. It was implemented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Medical content is bound by links to reference terminologies and ontologies. Results: OBEO provides classes and relations for the correct and almost complete representation of educational objectives. OBEO formalizes the relations between educational objective specifications and the concrete actions which realize them as well as the medical contents which are bound to them. Although OBEO uses only few own classes and relations, its complexity is already extensive. Conclusion: OBEO is a prototypical tool to annotate existing and developing educational objective catalogues and learning object resources for their better usability. OBEO has to be further developed and improved in regard to the representation of medical content in educational objectives and the inclusion of curricular context of educational objectives. The formal representation of OBEO enables the retrieval and navigation of annotated data in regard to content.
24013;SYSTEMS OF COMPUTER ONTOLOGIES AS A MEANS TO FORM FUTURE ENGINEERING TEACHERS DESIGN COMPETENCES;The article presents the results of empirical investigation of efficiency of using computer ontologies systems by future engineering teachers in the sphere of computer technologies as a means to form projecting competences. In the process of the research the components of the projecting competencies formation (motivational and target, cognitive and intellectual, professional, effective and reflexive) have been pointed out and investigated. The authors have analyzed quantitative indices of the level of projecting competencies formation by means of computer ontologies systems and have defined the level of each index development and the general level of their formation. We have also statistically processed the results of the empirical investigation of the use of computer ontologies systems as a means to form projecting competences of future engineering teachers.
24014;Model Based on Neutrosophic Ontologies for the Study of Entrepreneurship Competence;The entrepreneurship competence is of vital importance in the teacher training of students. It is inconceivable that citizens who are trained in schools do not have the ability to be autonomous, creative and daring, to make decisions that transform the social life in which we are immersed for the better. However, we do not always find institutions with the right education to develop this competence. That is why the aim of this article is to propose a model for the representation and obtaining of knowledge about the entrepreneurship competence in any educational system. For this end, there are neutrosophic ontologies, which is a tool to easily reflect the relationships between concepts. The use of neutrosophy allows us taking into account the truthfulness, falseness and indeterminacy of the belonging of an object to a specific set, for its evaluation and classification. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first time that neutrosophic ontology has been used to model entrepreneurship competence. Keywords: Entrepreneurship competence, ontology, neutrosophic ontology, education.
24017;Semi-automatic creation and exploitation of competence ontologies for trend aware profiling, matching and planning;Human resource managers are confronted with the problem that they have to fulfil the enterprise’s competence needs either by developing their current staff or by recruiting new employees. In both cases decisions about who to select for the new position and more often which competences are crucial for the future success. This is especially true for highly dynamic industries like the IT industry. This article presents our work from the KoPIWA project in the Digital Economy. Our approach is based on a conceptual model that encompasses the market level, the social context and relations between competences. This model is the foundation for the ontology based decision support system for human resource managers presented in this article. To semi-automatically create and update the competence ontology methods from the areas data mining, social network analysis and information retrieval are employed. The results of these methods with regard to recruiting and learning processes are presented.
24018;Exploring Automated Classification Approaches to Advance the Assessment of Collaborative Problem Solving Skills;Competency in skills associated with collaborative problem solving (CPS) is critical for many contexts, including school, the workplace, and the military. Innovative approaches for assessing individuals’ CPS competency are necessary, as traditional assessment types such as multiple -choice items are not well suited for such a process-oriented competency. In a move to computer-based environments to support CPS assessment, innovative computational approaches are also needed to understand individuals’ CPS behaviors. In the current study, we describe the use of a simulation-based task on electronics concepts as an environment for higher education students to display evidence of their CPS competency. We further describe computational linguistic methods for automatically characterizing students’ display of various CPS skills in the task. Comparisons between such an automated approach and an approach based on human annotation to characterize student CPS behaviors revealed above average agreement. These results give credence to the potential for automated approaches to help advance the assessment of CPS and to circumvent the time-intensive human annotation approaches that are typically used in these contexts.
24029;Using Ontologies for the E-learning System in Healthcare Human Resources Management;This paper provides a model for the use of ontology in e-learning systems for structuring educational content in the domain of healthcare human resources management (HHRM) in Romania. In this respect we propose an effective method to improve the learning system by providing personalized learning paths created using ontology and advanced educational strategies to provide a personalized learning content for the medical staff. Personalization of e-learning process for the chosen target group will be achieved by setting up learning path for each user according to his profile. This will become possible using: domain ontology, learning objects, modeling student knowledge. Developing an ontology-based system for competence management allows complex interactions, providing intelligent interfacing. This is a new approach for the healthcare system managers in permanent training based on e-learning technologies and specific ontologies in a complex area that needs urgent modernization and efficiency to meet the public health economic, social and political context of Romania.
24040;Engineering of educational programs through the application of intelligent technologies;One of the key tasks of the present stage of the education system development in Russia is to improve the practical orientation of specialists’ training for the modern labor market. On the agenda, there are the issues of modernization of educational programs in the direction of a closer relationship between education and professional standards, which is the main purpose of this study.Rapidly changing business needs, especially in the field of the booming ITindustry indicate the need for continuous improvement of mechanisms for the acquisition of new knowledge, abilities and skills of students, which in turn requires the development of special tools for the development of educational technologies. The article discusses the issues of flexible engineering education programs of higher education in accordance with the needs of the labour market, presented in professional standards. The methods of semantic modeling of informational and educational space, allowing to systematize the knowledge of the professional area in the form of conceptual models of ontologies and repositories of learning objects are offered as the methods of engineering.As the result of the correlation analysis of the categories of existing educational and professional standards, the mechanism to overcome the contradictions between the language of professional competences of educational standards and requirements of the labour functions of the professional standards is proposed. The paper describes the characteristics of the knowledge and skills of educational programs in the categories: scope, sphere and types of tasks of professional activities.The professional competences are differentiated due to profiles of training and types of professional tasks.The proposed universal algorithm for the development of educational programs of profile training on the base of the analysis of generalized labour functions and labour functions of professional standards can be useful to specialists, involved in designing of the basic professional educational programs on a wide range of directions and profiles of training
24046;Concept frame for curricular innovation in health care schools;We herein describe the conceptual dimension of the curricular innovation process carried out in the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Chile. We describe the context of innovation. The theoretical pertinence and relevance of a competence driven curriculum for health care professionals is discussed. The epistemological, ontological and didactic dimensions of the curricular innovation are examined. A main issue is the notion of competence and its significance in professional training. The curriculum is essentially considered as a moral endeavor, especially for health care professionals and their quest to improve the quality of life of the population.
24048;Uniform Assessment Of The Company's Employee's Competence Using Natural Language Processing Methods For Their Further Use In Corporate Knowledge Management Systems;"Introduction. The article determines the relevance of research in the field of creating uniform forms and methods for describing the knowledge, experience, and competencies of employees for their further accounting in corporate knowledge management systems; a comparative analysis of approaches to describing intellectual capital and employee competencies is presented. Approaches and methods. As a methodological basis, the functional subdivision of employee competencies is used according to the sources of its occurrence. The research is conducted based on an ontological approach and Natural Language Processing. The prospects of using the proposed set of methods for describing competencies are demonstrated. The results of the study. The paper shows that the most effective method of describing corporate knowledge, the carriers of which are the company's employees, is an educational-competence approach that divides such knowledge into four components: competencies acquired in the process of education, work experience, co-author activity, as well as Background knowledge. Moreover, the competencies themselves can be uniformly determined using comparative methods of linguistic analysis using frequency analysis of texts of documents related to the employee. Examples of solving specific problems by using Natural Language Processing methods in solving the tasks of assessing the competencies of employees are given. Discussion and conclusions. The work conducted has shown the possibility of creating a unified effective methodology for describing the professional competencies of the company's employees, which is an integral part of the general complex of corporate knowledge. The components of the methodology are already widely used in production practice."
24049;Competences and knowledge: Key-factors in the smart city of the future;The effective and modern management of competence development, which represents a distinguishing key-factor in future Smart Cities, cannot be limited to the Learning Management exclusively, but rather be inclusive of aspects pertaining to Human Capital and Performance Management in a holistic vision that encompasses not only the sphere of operations but also the tactical and strategic levels. In particular, organizations need solutions that especially integrate Learning Management, Performance Management, and Human Resource Management (HRM). We propose an approach considering the competences as key-factors in the management and valorization of Human Capital and making use of a socio-constructivist learning model, based on the explicit (ontological) modeling of domain competences as well as a learner and didactic oriented approach. Unlike most of the current solutions, far from the proposed vision and concentrated on specific functionalities and not on the processes as a whole, the solution offered by MOMA, spin-off of the Research Group of the University of Salerno led by Prof. Salerno, is here presented as a demonstrative case of the proposed methodology and approach. A distinctive feature of our proposal, supported by the MOMA solution is the adoption of semantic technologies that for instance allows for the discovery of unpredictable paths linking them in the Knowledge Graph. Finally, we discuss how this framework can be applied in the context of the Smart Cities of the future, taking advantage of the features, enabled especially by semantics, of researching, creating, combining, delivering and using in a creative manner the resources of superior quality offered by Smart Cities.

24062;Modeling competencies for supporting work-integrated learning in knowledge work;Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to suggest a way to support work-integrated learning for knowledge work, which poses a great challenge for current research and practice.Design methodology approach - The authors first suggest a workplace learning context model, which has been derived by analyzing knowledge work and the knowledge sources used by knowledge workers. The authors then focus on the part of the context that specifies competencies by applying the competence performance approach, a formal framework developed in cognitive psychology. From the formal framework, a methodology is then derived of how to model competence and performance in the workplace. The methodology is tested in a case study for the learning domain of requirements engineering.Findings - The Workplace Learning Context Model specifies an integrative view on knowledge workers' work environment by connecting learning, work and knowledge spaces. The competence performance approach suggests that human competencies be formalized with a strong connection to workplace performance (i.e. the tasks performed by the knowledge worker). As a result, competency diagnosis and competency gap analysis can be embedded into the normal working tasks and learning interventions can be offered accordingly. The results of the case study indicate that experts were generally in moderate to high agreement when assigning competencies to tasks.Research limitations implications - The model needs to be evaluated with regard to the learning outcomes in order to test whether the learning interventions offered benefit the user. Also, the validity and efficiency of competency diagnosis need to be compared to other standard practices in competency management.Practical implications - Use of competence performance structures within organizational settings has the potential to more closely relate the diagnosis of competency needs to actual work tasks, and to embed it into work processes.Originality value - The paper connects the latest research in cognitive psychology and in the behavioural sciences with a formal approach that makes it appropriate for integration into technology-enhanced learning environments.
24064;Competencies management and learning organizational memory;Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the MEMORAe project, the goal of which is to offer an alternative to the loss of competencies and knowledge in an organization.Design methodology approach - Within the project MEMORAe, interest was focused on the capitalization of knowledge and competencies in the context of an organization. The E-MEMORAe environment was developed based on the concept of learning organizational memory. This environment is dedicated to be used by a semantic learning organization as support for competency-based training. It is evaluated in this context.Findings - In the E-MEMORAe environment, learning content is indexed by knowledge and competencies organized by means of ontologies. Learners can acquire thise knowledge and these competencies by doing different tasks, accessing different contents. In the memory, competencies are defined via the knowledge they enable to be put into practice.Practical implications - It is known that some industrial communities of practice are interested in the use of E-MEMORAe.Originality value - Within the MEMORAe project, an ontology-based learning organizational memory is proposed as support for learning object retrieval by competency for competency based learning. Using such a memory enables and goes beyond organizational knowledge management. Knowledge and competencies are defined and structured to facilitate their access and their learning. This latter is also made possible thanks to the resources that they index.
24067;Business semantics management: A case study for competency-centric HRM;In this article we introduce a novel approach and tool for fact-oriented business semantics management that is inspired by agile design methods. We demonstrate and validate it in a realistic case study that was carried out within the European Codrive project. Codrive's vision was to contribute to more meaningful competency-centric human resource management. Key challenges are the uniform publication of unambiguous competency information and “time-to-competency? agility. To this end, we developed a shared and formal knowledge representation of competency domains. Stakeholders include educational institutes, public employment organisations, and industry partners from different European countries. The resulting Vocational Competency Ontology wanted to provide a candidate best practice for engineering a community-shared and reusable Semantic Pattern Base that can be applied by all stakeholders to semantically reconcile their contextualised competency models.
24078;Methodology of developing an ontological model for the formation of content and assessment of ICT competencies of university students;"The relevance of the work is confirmed by the need to ensure that vocational training meets the requirements of formal and non-formal, difficult to coordinate requirements of the education system and the labor market. The article proposes one way to solve this problem in the framework of control theory and knowledge engineering. A methodology for developing an ontological model is proposed and described for the formation of the content and assessment of ICT competencies of university students, based on two basic ideas: first, the definition of the boundaries of the subject area of competencies, for which the content and means of assessment are formed on the basis of harmonized regulatory framework (boundaries are defined by invariant and variant documents.); secondly, a mechanism for taking into account personal characteristics and needs in order to build an individual trajectory of professional education and self-training should be conceptualized and preliminarily designed. An ontological model developed based on this technique is presented for forming the content and evaluating the competencies of IT specialists using the example of the subject field “IT solutions for business on the 1C: Enterprise platform?. The development of the research topic is possible in the direction of expanding the functionality of the ontological model in terms of preparing for certification exams from venders, adding other areas of preparation and adding other subject areas. The knowledge base created based on the ontological model can become part of intelligent information systems of decision support for education systems and corporate training, as well as HR management. This article will be of interest to specialists involved in the development of new tools and methods for managing the educational process and self-learning processes in distance education systems."
24087;Designing a work program for the discipline based on the elements of competencies;"The aim of the research is to develop and approve the methodology for the preparation and actualization of the work programs of the academic disciplines and practices of the basic vocational education program of higher education that meets the requirements of the federal state educational standard of higher education of 2017 on the basis of the elements of competences allocated from texts of professional and educational standards, subject area standards, scientific, methodological and other sources.The approach, recommended by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation is the expression of the set of professional knowledge, skills necessary for the graduate in the formulations of several dozens of competences, presupposes a set of formulas that are much more general than in professional standards and subject area standards, are decomposed into separate themes of contact classes and independent preparation of students. At the same time, there are risks of missing or duplicating material in different disciplines and arbitrariness in the interpretation of general formulations of competencies by different authors of methodological developments. According to the authors, the use of the elements of competences allocated from the texts of standards, scientific and methodological developments and other sources of the subject field of activity of the university graduate, allows to determine the set and content of knowledge, skills and knowledge necessary for training in the field of preparation more fully, rationally distribute them among educational disciplines and practices, to form the main didactic units of the work program of the academic discipline, to ensure the traceability of the requirements to the results of mastering the disciplines to a specific source of requirements.In the process of research, a methodology for the collection, processing and systematization of information necessary for the preparation of documents for the organization of the educational process at the department of the university was developed and approved; the analysis of professional and branch standards of software engineering is carried out; an array of elements of competencies required by the graduate training directions 09.03.04 is formed; software tools for processing and structuring information, managing changes in the elements of competences, taking into account the interrelations between them are proposed.The article describes the structure of the data array of competencies required by the graduate of the bachelor’s degree in the direction of training 09.03.04 “Software Engineering?; the results of the analysis of the main types of competence sources are presented: the educational standard in the specified direction of bachelor’s degree, professional standards and branch standards of software engineering, ontological and architectural models of entities of the subject domain; an algorithm for the collection, processing and systematization of information necessary for the formation of competency elements; examples of forming various types elements of competences are given.The study has showed that the competence approach, expanded in the proposed methodology, to the formation of working programs of educational disciplines and practices of the basic professional educational program of higher education allows to ensure the completeness, relevance and consistency of the requirements for the preparation of students, the rational distribution of the subject matter of the teaching material between disciplines and their mutual coherence in the educational process."
24097;Internet Projecting as Means of Implementing the Federal State Educational Standards in Pedagogical University;"The article presents the Internet projecting as a means of implementing the project, cyber-ontological and the competence approaches in education. Based on the analysis of federal state educational standard of higher education in the directions of training “Psychology,? “Psychological and pedagogical education? and “Social work,? the author identified the competencies that can be actualized in the process of creating the students own Internet-projects. They include the following competences: understanding the importance of professional activity and readiness for its implementation; willingness and ability to self-education and professional self-development; ability to work (to organize work) in a team; ability to effective oral and written communication, educational activities, goal setting and achieving professional goals, self-organization, application of knowledge and skills into practice, professional reflection; having the culture of information and communication activities and the capacity to implement projects, to organize and evaluate project activities of students. To test the hypothesis, the author created and implemented a module “Internet-projecting? in the framework of the academic disciplines at the faculty of pedagogics and psychology of Moscow State University of Education. A system of competence evaluation of the implementation of Internet projects is introduced. The results of the empirical work allowed to conclude about the effectiveness of Internet projecting as a form of academic work, ensuring the development of these competences among students of pedagogical university."
24111;KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER AS ONE OF THE FACTORS OF INCREASING UNIVERSITY COMPETITIVENESS;The paper deals with university knowledge transfer. The adjustment of relations between universities and enterprises makes knowledge transfer a necessary requirement for university development to ensure the implementation of market-oriented educational programs. The paper proposes use of modular competency-based and ontological approaches to ensure the university knowledge transfer. The initial data is presented in the databases of the university, authorized bodies of education and science, enterprises, business structures and professional standards. This data is processed and scanned for knowledge to be put into the knowledge database with technological (informational) and modular competency-based approaches.  As part of a market-oriented innovation university concept the task is to improve the education system in relation to skills development. To solve this problem it is necessary to build a distributed information system of university knowledge transfer. It is necessary to create a unified educational space - an educational portal - to ensure the university knowledge transfer between all participants - teachers, students and employers. The study offers an architectural solution for a distributed information system.
24126;An Ontological Approach to Test Student's Competences in Meta-Subject Concepts;Student’s meta-subject (cross-curriculum) competences are a part of his/her metacompetences that include also metacognitive and meta-creative competences. By the metasubject competences the Federal State Educational Standard means student’s learning outcomes as a result of the universal learning activities to ensure gained knowledge of key competences being a basis of ability to study, as well as learning outcomes of cross-curriculum concepts (meta-concepts). The aim of the paper is to assess student’s learning outcomes when having a meta-concept based curriculum.The offered approach uses a cognitive student’s card (CSC), which formalizes his/her understanding of some fragment of the subject semantic net (SSN) and, theoretically, coincides with this fragment. The assessment for the student’s knowledge of the conceptual constituents of this fragment of SSN is controlled by comparison of the SSN sub-graph corresponding to this fragment with the graph which is defined by the corresponding CSC.Since both so-called meta-subjects and traditional subjects can provide a meta-subject learning proficiency we consider two approaches to test student’s knowledge of meta-concepts. The first one is based on the meta-subject ontology while the other one uses the ontologies of traditional subjects.The Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation supported (project 2014- 14-579-0144) this work.
24139;Ontological simulation for educational process organisation in a higher educational institution;Following the new-generation standards is needed to form a task list connected with planning and organizing of an academic process, structure and content formation of degree programmes. Even when planning the structure and content of an academic process, one meets some problems concerning the necessity to assess the correlation between degree programmes and demands of educational and professional standards and to consider today's job-market and students demands. The paper presents examples of ontological simulations for solutions of organizing educational process problems in a higher educational institution and gives descriptions of model development. The article presents two examples: ontological simulation when planning an educational process in a higher educational institution and ontological simulation for describing competences of an IT-specialist. The paper sets a conclusion about ontology application perceptiveness for formalization of educational process organization in a higher educational institution.
24156;Components of the competencies involved in new degrees at some Spanish universities;The European Higher Education Area requires the adaptation of formal university qualifications to the teaching and learning model designed to develop competencies. The new degrees must necessarily include an explicit statement of the competencies to be achieved by students by the end of their university education. The documents listing these competencies are crucial tools for analyzing, evaluating and comparing what different universities have to offer. This paper looks at a sample of the competency documents pertaining to different degrees at various public and private Spanish universities. The study combines the qualitative and quantitative methods, with content analysis and text mining as its foundations. A hybrid manual/statistical procedure based on the ontology of knowledge, stemming from the component model of competencies, is applied to the body of documents to identify and select a dictionary of concepts. The dictionary is then used to assign a code to each of the competencies in the body of documents, in order to obtain a structured form that can be subjected to statistical analysis. The main result is a map of the percentage composition of average overall competency, which consists of 33.4% knowledge, 56.9% capabilities and 9.7% attitudes. Results are also presented by competency type, branch of knowledge and degree. The composition of average competency, both in overall terms and in terms of branches of knowledge, shows significant deviations from the guidelines given in the references. Attitudes account for a singularly low percentage, and the balance between knowledge and capabilities is skewed. Future revisions of competency statements should strive to correct the imbalances among the competency components observed in the study.

24184;DeCom: A model for context-aware competence management;•We propose DeCom, a model for context-aware competences management.•A case study involving an ERP company enabled data collection on a real scenario.•One expert executed eight scenarios to evaluate the functionalities of DeCom.•Three scenarios detailed how DeCom explores the employee's context in a business environment.•Twenty-one users tried DeCom and answered a questionnaire based on TAM methodology.This article proposes a model of a context-aware system, called DeCom, to support competence management. The model considers the profiles of employees in organizations and the contexts in which they are involved, looking for opportunities to help them to develop their competences. DeCom proposes a Context Model organized into five categories, which enable the mapping of employees’ mobility and development, using context-based information (people, events and other resources). Moreover, the model proposes a Competence Model specifically oriented towards contexts. A case study involving an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) vendor enabled data collection based on realistic scenarios. The model was implemented based on multiplatform programming for mobile devices. This prototype and the case study were used in an evaluation involving the IT manager from the ERP vendor. The specialized evaluator executed eight scenarios to test the functionalities of DeCom. The article discussed the result of this evaluation and describes three scenarios in detail to better demonstrate how DeCom explores the employee's context in a business environment. Moreover, the article summarizes an acceptance evaluation conducted with twenty-one volunteers to test the DeCom's usability. The results were encouraging and show the potential for implementing DeCom as a tool to foster the competence management in organizations and to support corporate education activities.

According to the components of design competences the criteria (operational, evaluative and analytical) have been defined and indices of their formation in using computer ontology systems in the professional activity of future engineering teachers in the field of computer technologies have been determined."
24213;Substantiation of the necessity to develop a competency model of training specialist in pharmacy on the basis of intellectual educational system;"The pharmaceutical market of Ukraine, in which various subjects of drug turnover operate, is gradually moving to basically new level. The development is taking place due tothe fundamental factors such as competence and the quality of pharmaceutical activities. The changes on the pharmaceutical market, tough competitive conditions, transforming of the managerial culture intensity, the problems of not always appropriate competence of specialists and require fundamental changes in the system of pharmaceutical education. The purpose. To conduct research of the links in social and economic relations between higher educational institutions and employers in the labor market through the analysis of future graduates`professional competence for the pharmaceutical industry and substantiate the necessity for the development of competency-based training model on the basis of adaptive intellectual computer system of training. Materials and methods. The study was conducted using the methods of semantic evaluation of legal and scientific documents, comparison, systemic and structural logical analysis. Results and discussion. Competence approach has been implemented in most European countries at the level of national educational standards. The current system of pharmaceutical education in Ukraine is normative and it is based on the branch standards of higher education-educational qualification characteristics and educational and vocational program. Market conditions encourage employers to determine and order specialists with a definite set of professional competencies, constantly updating and upgrading knowledge who fully meet the requirements of the position defined independent on the subjects of the system of drug provision. Therefore, it is necessary to synchronize ""production"" of the education system and ""demand"" of the labor market. It`s obvious, the solution of this problem is possible only with the introduction of new educational technologies to create a model of professional competence that are actively using the latest advances in the sphere of information technologies. The prism of professional pharmaceutical activitiesallocates an object-oriented approach, based on practice-oriented methods, new requirements for the organization of problem-based training by creating a new educational environment (computer systems of training) for the development of modular programs both at enterprise and at educational institution, new approaches to assessing the quality of training through the evaluation of the level in mastering disciplines, professional modules and assessment of students`competence. One of the means to implement subject-oriented training is - the development of intellectual educational systems of different types. In the basis of these systems should be the model of pharmacist`sknowledge based on competence and which will involve theoretical knowledge, characteristics and criteria for practical skills` assessment, the parameters of the surroundings in which he will work, built on the grounds of ontology. Conclusions. The standard of a new generation of education in the pharmaceutical market can be implemented based on a competency model using an adaptive intellectual computer system of training, which main aim is to organize personalized student`straining. This system will include the model of professional`s knowledge and modular courses that will optimize and speed up the development of curricula and methodologicalmaterials in accordance with the wishes and requirements of employers. This will make it possible to implement training small groups with the assigned competencies."
24231;Collective sports games teaching: essential competencies and game logic amid the systemic organizational process;This descriptive and propositive article has the objective of addressing the teaching process of the collective sports games, assuming that they should be understood in view of the ontological nature of the game, of the organizational process and of the inherent logic of collective games. We propose the teaching process by considering the idea of essential competencies as a reference, which stem from the interaction between structural and functional references, which balance the game logic. Thus we have laid the foundation for the development of a methodology outlined by the game and by the parameters for structuring the syllabus of competency-based training.

24263;Competencias más importantes para la disciplina administrativa en Colombia;A partir de los resultados encontrados del Proyecto Tuning Latin-America, que se replicó en Colombia, esta investigación identifica de las 47 competencias del proyecto, las 5 más importantes según la percepción de los académicos y de los empleadores, las cuales deben ser tenidas en cuenta para garantizar buenos resultados de los profesionales en administración. Las competencias también se han clasificado de acuerdo con los fundamentos filosóficos de Bédard en ontológicas, axiológicas, epistemológicas, praxiológicas. Este estudio usa una orientación descriptiva cuando se construye el ranking de las competencias y aplica una inferencia estadística para determinar el nivel de importancia de ellas. Los resultados muestran una percepción diferente para académicos y empleadores. Sin embargo, empleadores y académicos piensan que los administradores están orientados a los elementos epistemológicos y praxiológicos, tanto en las competencias genéricas como específicas. Se puede concluir que es necesario hacer un esfuerzo para cerrar la brecha entre los conocimientos y los aspectos prácticos frente a los conceptos éticos, morales y los principios ontológicos mediante una buena educación impartida en las instituciones de educación superior.Based on results of the Tuning Latin-America Project, replicated in Colombia, this research identifies the 5 most important competencies according to the mean of perception from academicians and employers to be taken into account for the performance of administration professionals. Competencies are classified according to the philosophical foundations taking into account Bédard's approach of: ontological, axiological, epistemological and praxeological. This study uses a descriptive orientation on the construction of a ranking and applies statistical inference to determine the level of importance of competencies. Results show different perceptions between academicians and employers. Employers and academicians think that managers are oriented to the epistemology and praxeology, both for generic and specific competencies. It can be concluded that it is necessary to close the gap between the knowledge and praxis versus values and principles through education in higher education institutions.
24269;Tecnologías emergentes en instituciones educativas: ventajas y riegos potenciales;This article is a review of some aspects of research on electronic portfolios with a critical analysis ofthe pros and cons of the invasive use of new technologies for education. Besides the creation andconceptual composition of educative portfolios that help teachers grow professionnally, thisinstrument implies a formatting around artifacts posited as proofs of competence, which support anuncritical realist ontology that has its limitations. Thus networked learning and personal learningenvironments stimulate reflective teacher learning, but possibly lead portfolio users to confuse theindicator of performance with the actual competence. Portfolio creation takes much time on otheractivities that could be most beneficial (and could be complementary), such as shared reflection onpersonal belief systems. Universalist stands and standardisation seem to take the fore whileeducative humane value go back stage. The new wave of distance learning creates new risks interms of depth and quality as well as health, related to the daily use of pulsed microwaves and radiofrequencies. It is suggested that a mode of control independent from the financial milieux thatcapitalize on these innovations should be created.Este artículo revisa algunos elementos de la investigación sobre el portafolio electrónico.

24271;TRAINING BACHELORS AT ON THE BASIS OF MATCHING EDUCATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS (THE EXAMPLE OF THE EDUCATIONAL STANDARD 072300 “MUSEOLOGY AND PROTECTION OF CULTURAL AND NATURAL HERITAGE?);"The authors use the example of the educational standard 072300 ""Museology and Protection of Cultural and Natural Heritage"", Bachelor’s Degree, to consider the possibility of resolving the contradictions of the disparity between the results of training future Bachelors and the norms substantiating the trends of the development of the profession. The paper analyzes the competences listed in the educational standard ""Museology and Protection of Cultural and Natural Heritage"" and the knowledge, skills and practical abilities in accordance with the accepted professional standards in the field of Museology. On the basis of these documents, competence, ontological and profile models of competency allowing to train competitive, highly skilled Bachelors-Museologists was developped."
24275;Evaluation of the Project Management Competences Based on the Semantic Networks;The paper presents the testing and evaluation facilities of the SinPers system. The SinPers is a web based learning environment in project management, capable of building and conducting a complete and personalized training cycle, from the definition of the learning objectives to the assessment of the learning results for each learner. The testing and evaluation facilities of SinPers system are based on the ontological approach. The educational ontology is mapped on a semantic network. Further, the semantic network is projected into a concept space graph. The semantic computability of the concept space graph is used to design the tests. The paper focuses on the applicability of the system in the certification, for the knowledge assessment, related to each element of competence. The semantic computability is used for differentiating between different certification levels.

24314;A framework for building competency-based systems dedicated to human resource management;CommOn is a framework which aims at developing operational systems dedicated to the management of competencies. Such a Competency-Based System can be used for different purposes such as staff development and deployment, job analysis or economic evaluation. CommOn is based on two models (implemented with specific tools) which guide (i) the building of competency reference systems related to particular domains such as Healthcare or Information and Telecommunication, (ii) the identification and the formal representation of competency profiles and (iii) the matching of competency profiles. Developed in the context of Semantic Web Technology, the CommOn framework allows one to build shareable ontologies and knowledge bases represented with Semantic Web Languages and to develop Competency-Based Web Services dedicated to Human Resource Management. The use of CommOn is illustrated in the context of a project related to e-recruitment (http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/irin/commoncv/).
24316;A competency framework for Ph.D. programs in health information management;"•There are no competency frameworks specifically developed for Ph.D. educational programs in health information management (HIM).•We developed a competency framework for Ph.D. educational programs with the participation of faculty members and students/graduates in HIM.•This framework suggests a list of competencies in 11 domains and 71 sub-domains.•This framework considers the transition of HIM practices to digital health and health information technologies.The job expectations and professional competencies required by health information management (HIM) students/graduates are constantly changing and workforce development requires curricula in line with new emerging competencies. Although there are some competency frameworks in this field, there is no one specifically for Ph.D. educational programs in HIM. We aimed to develop a competency framework for Ph.D. programs in HIM in Iran.We firstly developed a list of competencies based on those published in the literature or by related associations in nine domains and 51 sub-domains. We used the modified Delphi technique and invited Ph.D. students/graduates in HIM and related faculty members throughout the country to participate. Competencies with more than 75% agreement were considered as high priority competencies and those with 50% to 75% agreement as a medium priority. Competencies with less than 50% agreement were dropped. After two rounds, the competency framework was finalized.All suggested competencies were considered a high priority in the first round. Based on suggestions, two new domains (health knowledge management and information technology) and 20 new sub-competencies were added and then accepted in the second round. The final framework includes these competency domains: health data and information management; health data analytics; information technology; teaching competencies; research competencies; health information technology and digital health; health information classifications, terminologies, and ontologies; health information systems governance; managerial competencies; health knowledge management; and digital health entrepreneurship.This framework suggests a list of competencies in 11 domains and 71 sub-domains for Ph.D. students/graduates in HIM that should be considered for the development of future curricula for these educational programs."
24323;Information Support of Design Innovation Activity of the Technical University;The problem of adaptation of educational space of technical university to modern market requirements is considered. There are described the results of studying the requests of higher education applicants and their vision of the success of the study. The aim of the article is to build an architecture of an information system similar to that used by modern enterprises, which will provide a combination of scientific, design and educational activities of the academic community, taking into account market needs. The main scientific research methods are bibliographic analysis, comparative analysis, methods of analogies. The conceptual architecture of the Information Support of Design Innovation Activity of the Technical University system based on the construction of a unified scientific and educational information space is described. The main task of the university’s information space is to prepare students for activities of the real market. There are determined the necessity and limits of application of the modern access control system at the universities of Ukraine, in particular for the organization of independent work of students. There is offered the way to reach the 4th level of technological readiness of students ‘and teachers’ development. The construction of an ontological description of the subject area of a technical university, the development of the application of a grid model for the description of scientific and technical information, and the determination of the current technical status are defined as the basis of the system of setting tasks for project groups in the transition to project-oriented learning. The question of the appropriateness of using adaptive case management system as a basic concept of building electronic document management system is resolved. The use of the competence approach as a mechanism of stimulating technical creativity within the educational process and in the work of researchers from the University staff is considered.
24330;Work in progress - Studying design cognition to improve design education;This paper presents results from the first phase of a longitudinal study of design cognition. The project examines how engineering students develop design competencies over time by applying a task-independent approach to verbal protocol analysis based on the function-behavior-structure ontology. This analysis will be used to evaluate the effects of education on design cognition by following students in two curricula across three years (sophomore to senior). A large study pool from both programs completed spatial reasoning tests to determine overall population characteristics. A subset of this pool is now participating in verbal protocol studies in which students work in pairs to respond to a design scenario. This paper reports results of the spatial reasoning tests as well as preliminary results from the first set of protocol studies.
24348;SEMANTIC PROCESSING OF INFORMATION RESOURCES OF LABOUR MARKET;"The urgency of developing approaches to the integration of the market of educational services with the labor market through the transition from qualification models to full-fledged competence ones on base of implementation of the ""passport of acquired competences"" that accompanies a person throughout his/her personality development and professional career is substantiated. Theoretical researches in the field of processing of information about acquired qualifications and competencies as well as tools that are built on their basis are analyzed. The ESCO classifier which unites the labor markets of various EU member states, allows job seekers and employers to operate more effectively with information of result of learning. The main limitations of existing approaches are identified; ways of solving these problems by means of information processing at the semantic level are suggested. Modern information technologies focused on processing distributed heterogeneous Web resources are considered, and the most suitable ones for solving this problem are identified. The principles of developing the information system UkrESCO, which is designed for semantic processing of information resources about acquired qualifications and competencies based on the model of the multilingual skills classifier, competencies, qualifications and occupations of ESCO, relevant for the European market of work, education and vocational training, are theoretically grounded. This system is based on Semantic Web technologies and solutions, namely software agents, Web services and ontologies. The generalized architecture of UkrESCO system and its ontological model are proposed. The scheme of the UkrESCO interaction with external retrieval systems and structured information resources which are based on Wiki-technology is proposed. This scheme provides access to the knowledge of the subject domain and the update of information about the subjects of the labour market. Use of the UkrESCO ontology allows to perform a semantic retrieval on the Web and find both natural language information resources with certain properties as well as ensure the interaction of the UkrESCO with semantically marked resources."

The current study provides details on professions from the engineering domain that are modeled using a prototype ontology tailored to the context of Industry 4.0 in the Romanian landscape. Our ontology represents the foundations for providing personalized recommendations to find suitable professions in the Romanian job market while illustrating the importance of AI tools to support career development.
24356;Desarrollo de una ontología para la conceptualización de un ambiente virtual de aprendizaje constructivista;En este trabajo se describen los avances en el desarrollo e implementación de una ontología para el dominio de conocimiento de un ambiente virtual de aprendizaje llamado Sistema Generador de Ambientes de Enseñanza-Aprendizaje Constructivistas basados en Objetos de Aprendizaje (AMBAR), actualmente en desarrollo. Para el desarrollo de la ontología se utilizó la herramienta de código abierto Protégé, utilizando el plugin OWL. Se determinó el dominio y alcance de la ontología y se revisaron ontologías ya existentes. Se definieron las clases y la jerarquía de clases, definiendo como principales las siguientes: Servicios, Metadata, Roles, Método, Objetos de Aprendizaje, Actividades, Competencias, Framework y Personas. Cada una de éstas fue descrita y se establecieron las relaciones entre ellas. El desarrollo de la ontología permitió compartir y consensuar el conocimiento del dominio dentro del equipo multidisciplinario involucrado en el Proyecto AMBAR, y permitirá dotarlo de mecanismos inteligentes de búsqueda basadas en la visión de la Web semántica.
24364;Emerging technologies in educational institutions: assets and potential risks;This article is a review of some aspects of research on electronic portfolios with a critical analysis of the pros and cons of the invasive use of new technologies for education. Besides the creation and conceptual composition of educative portfolios that help teachers grow professionnally, this instrument implies a formatting around artifacts posited as proofs of competence, which support an uncritical realist ontology that has its limitations. Thus networked learning and personal learning environments stimulate reflective teacher learning, but possibly lead portfolio users to confuse the indicator of performance with the actual competence. Portfolio creation takes much time on other activities that could be most beneficial (and could be complementary), such as shared reflection on personal belief systems. Universalist stands and standardisation seem to take the fore while educative humane value go back stage. The new wave of distance learning creates new risks in terms of depth and quality as well as health, related to the daily use of pulsed microwaves and radio frequencies. It is suggested that a mode of control independent from the financial milieux that capitalize on these innovations should be created.
24424;Ontology engineering in the era of linked data;EDITOR'S SUMMARYOntology engineering encompasses the method, tools and techniques used to develop ontologies. Without requiring ontologies, linked data is driving a paradigm shift, bringing benefits and drawbacks to the publishing world. Ontologies may be heavyweight, supporting deep understanding of a domain, or lightweight, suited to simple classification of concepts and more adaptable for linked data. They also vary in domain specificity, usability and reusabilty. Hybrid vocabularies drawing elements from diverse sources often suffer from internally incompatible semantics. To serve linked data purposes, ontology engineering teams require a range of skills in philosophy, computer science, web development, librarianship and domain expertise.
24442;Ontology based system to guide internship assignment process;Internship assignment is a complicated process for universities since it isnecessary to take into account a multiplicity of variables to establish acompromise between companies' requirements and student competencies acquiredduring the university training. These variables build up a complex relationsmap that requires the formulation of an exhaustive and rigorous conceptualscheme. In this research a domain ontological model is presented as support tothe student's decision making for opportunities of University studies level ofthe University Lumiere Lyon 2 (ULL) education system. The ontology is designedand created using methodological approach offering the possibility of improvingthe progressive creation, capture and knowledge articulation. In this paper, wedraw a balance taking the demands of the companies across the capabilities ofthe students. This will be done through the establishment of an ontologicalmodel of an educational learners' profile and the internship postings which arewritten in a free text and using uncontrolled vocabulary. Furthermore, weoutline the process of semantic matching which improves the quality of queryresults.
24455;O novo status do saber na era tecnológica e os desafios para a educação segundo Hans Jonas;O objetivo do presente artigo é analisar a mudança no estatuto do saber a partir da era moderna e suas repercussões sobre a educação no século vinte um, tendo como referência a filosofia de Hans Jonas. Para tanto, analisaremos como o conhecimento perdeu seu valor contemplativo, ontológica e politicamente falando, para assumir uma perspectiva de exploração do mundo, chegando a apresentar-se ele mesmo como uma mercadoria, na forma da informação. Contrapõe-se, assim, o homo faber ao homo sapiens, com o prejuízo do segundo. À educação cabe enfrentar a tensão entre o fazer e o saber, recusando uma visão simplista da ideia de competências e assumindo uma posição crítica capaz de preparar o ser humano integralmente para assumir a sua responsabilidade diante dos novos poderes da tecnologia.
24463;Representation of an Electrical Engineering Curriculum Using an Ontology of Controlled Quality;A curriculum is a complex system that includes a set of core competencies, objectives, contents, methodological and evaluation criteria, regulation among other things. In order to represent a curriculum as a piece of software the common tools used are databases, trees and lists of courses. However, none of these tools can capture the deep and complex relationships among the elements of a curriculum. To avoid this problem, a more complete representation of an engineering curriculum using ontologies has been developed. This paper presents the construction of an ontology for undergraduate electrical engineering curriculum domain at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, which aims to represent, organize, formalize and standardize the knowledge of this domain, so that it can be shared and reused by different groups of people in the field of education and engineering. The ontology includes four curriculum aspects： knowledge in electrical engineering, skills in engineering, electrical engineering curriculum and regulation. For the ontology development, Methontology was selected as methodology and Protege as implementation tool. In addition, there is a proposal of documentation for this methodology, based on principles of quality management systems. This ontology is designed in order to be used in any field of engineering.
24466;Análisis videográfico para la evaluación de los aprendizajes en las prácticas externas de la formación inicial de docentes de secundaria;Las tecnologías emergentes del vídeo digital (ontologías, reconocimiento de voz e imagen, anotaciones, etc.) permiten establecer nuevas interacciones entre usuarios y otorgan posibilidades innovadoras a las ya conocidas ventajas en la enseñanza universitaria, como la documentación de evidencias multimedia en los portafolios electrónicos del estudiante de prácticas externas. El presente trabajo muestra el modelo de uso, al tiempo que señala líneas de investigación para mejorar la docencia, con ejemplos de análisis de contenidos y reflexiones pedagógicas vertidas en las anotaciones de un grupo de 21 estudiantes del máster de secundaria en el momento de diseñar sus unidades didácticas en las prácticas. Entre las conclusiones, destaca que la utilización del vídeo se ha mostrado útil especialmente para aquellos estudiantes que no provienen de una formación de grado en educación, porque la teorización pedagógica mediante el análisis de imágenes y de evidencias visuales facilita las ejemplificaciones metodológicas, la discusión, la argumentación y la interiorización de modelos teóricos y prácticos. Por tanto, se demuestra cómo documentar los portafolios electrónicos y analizar las prácticas con evidencias de vídeo es una metodología, una línea de investigación innovadora y una competencia profesional en la formación del docente de secundaria.
24490;Constructing expert profiles over time for skills management and expert finding;"Expert profiling and identification are important to both knowledge workers and organizations. To this end, skills management and expert recommender systems facilitate the management of skills and competencies and help find appropriate experts to meet a particular need. In this paper, we present a technique for generating evolving expert profiles of individuals composed of their skills and competencies using heterogeneous data from divergent sources of information. We use self-declarations, completed learning activities, and previous work experience to generate the initial profile. Recommendations, ""wisdom of the crowd"""", direct observations of online and offline activities, and content generated by the individual both within the organization and on the Web are then used to enrich the profiles and to assess and validate skills and competencies over time."

24570;Toward an approach to create selforganizing and reflexive information systems project practitioners;Purpose The primary purpose of this paper is to present an alternative approach to educate information systems project practitioners. An alternative to the prescriptive, model based, instrumental approaches is sought. The alternative approach presented in this paper focuses largely on imparting a discourse to equip students with an understanding of how communication occurs, how competences are acquired, and how to understand the influences of power and agency on themselves and others in a typical information systems project context. Designmethodologyapproach A conceptual approach is followed. First, Heidegger's ideas are used to demonstrate the flaws inherent in assumptions that claim we interact in project management contexts in rational, and instrumental ways. Second, the paper argues that Cockburn's concepts, which are traditionally used as a theoretical lens to understand agile software development practices, are a good approximate to Heidegger's concepts to impart reflexive learning skills. Finally, the concept of a discourse is used to package the instrumental tools, reflexive learning skills and related concepts to understand communication, and the acquisition of competence. Findings There are many parallels that can be drawn between the dilemmas, which face the project management community, and the ideological debates about agile versus monolithic approaches, for which the software development community is infamous. Additionally, Heidegger's motivation for defining the fundamental ontology of dasein is similar to the motivation given by the research community to understand actual project experiences. Research limitationsimplications This approach has only been tried at one institution thus far hence, there are only two semesters of teaching experiences at one institution on which to reflect. Practical implications The paper advances the dilemma related to project practitioner education to a point where action can be taken. Educators can use the ideas presented in this paper to revive undergraduate project management education programs both in information systems and other disciplines. Originalityvalue The original value is twofold. First, there is a presentation of an alternative approach to educate information systems project practitioners that holds the promise of making the experience more true to life thereby, rendering the experience more fulfilling for the practitioner. Second, the paper uses Heidegger's fundamental ontology to show the consequence of imparting the ideals of instrumentality rationality in a true to life manner. This discussion highlights some of the effects contemporary educational approaches have on retarding competence and competency development.
24597;Anàlisi videogràfica per avaluar els aprenentatges en les pràctiques externes de la formació inicial de docents de secundària;Les tecnologies emergents del vídeo digital (ontologies, reconeixement de veu i imatge, anotacions, etc.) permeten establir interaccions noves entre usuaris i atorguen possibilitats innovadores als coneguts avantatges del vídeo a l’ensenyament universitari, com poden ser la documentació d’evidències multimèdia en els portafolis electrònics de l’estudiant de les pràctiques externes. En aquest treball en mostrem el model d’ús, alhora que assenyalem línies d’investigació per millorar la docència, amb exemples d’anàlisi de continguts i reflexions pedagògiques abocades en les anotacions d’un grup de 21 estudiants del màster de secundària en el moment de dissenyar les seves unitats didàctiques en les pràctiques. Entre les conclusions, podem avançar que s’ha considerat que la utilització del vídeo ha estat útil especialment per a aquells estudiants que no provenen d’una formació de grau en educació, perquè la teorització pedagògica amb l’anàlisi d’imatges i d’evidències visuals facilita les exemplificacions metodològiques, la discussió, l’argumentació i la interiorització de models teòrics i pràctics. Per tant, es demostra com documentar els portafolis electrònics i analitzar les pràctiques amb evidències de vídeo és una metodologia, una línia de recerca innovadora i una competència professional en la formació del docent de secundària.

69642;Competence Ontology for Network Building;"The overall objective of this research is to engineer a decision aid approach to support the identification of collaborative networks which could then constitute potential Virtual Breeding Environments. An interesting aspect of this approach is working with internet and thus considered an ""open universe"" of potential partners. In this perspective, the paper puts the focus on extracting essential facets of firm competences using an ontology approach. The method followed to construct the ontology is presented as well as a brief introduction on its use. This work is part of an on going project to produce cognitive aids to support decisions when seeking to form partnerships and establish VBEs."
69646;A Survey on Educational Ontologies and Their Development Cycle;Nowadays, the grid of Internet has demonstrated to be plentiful and tremendous data source of information, where diverse domains can be reached and mined. Semantic web is part of the Internet grid where knowledge is provided and has a predefined sense. People can use the big quantity of accessible information for entertainment, exploring knowledge, and learning. In this paper, we provide a survey of educational ontologies, their development life cycle, and the tools used for their implementation. The classification outcomes are beneficial not only for practicality purposes but also for building educational ontologies and their reusability, since it provides a framework for selecting the suitable methodology to be used in specific context, depending also on the requirements of the application itself.
69647;Exploiting Cloud Computing in Competence Management: A Pharmacy Case;Competencies as abstractions of human’s behavior in work have proven to be useful concept in making human skills, knowledge and abilities manageable. Unfortunately competence management systems are overly complex and difficult to maintain for most small organizations as they do not have enough ICT resources. Cloud computing is an interesting choice for competence management as it allows organizations to use applications without own ICT resources: Anyone with a suitable Internet connection and a standard browser can access an application in a cloud. We have analyzed the suitability of cloud-based competence management for pharmacies. It turned out that in pharmacies cloud computing does not only reduce the costs but it also provides new ways for sharing and exploiting competence-oriented information among relevant parties including pharmacies’ staff, educational institutions and medical authorities. From technology point of view our designed cloud-based Competence Server uses OWL and RDF in managing the HR- (Human Resource) ontology. We also present how OWL ontologies can be transformed into relational model and stored in relational database systems. In addition, we analyze the suitability of various cloud deployment and service models for competence management.
69648;A Knowledge-Skill-Competencies e-Learning Model in Mathematics;This paper concerns modelling competence in mathematics in an e-learning environment. Competence is something complex, which goes beyond the cognitive level, and involves meta-cognitive and non-cognitive factors. It requires students to master knowledge and skills and at least some measurable abilities, which Niss calls ‘competencies’. We present a model that exploits the innovative technological features of the IWT platform to define a personalised learning experience allowing students to increase their competence in mathematics. It is based on knowledge and skills representations by means of a graph metaphor, and on a theoretical framework for modelling competence.
69651;Development of Web-Based Learning Scenarios in the Semantic Web – A Connection of Didactical Aspects and Ontological Structures;This paper investigates how teachers can be supported and guided in the planning of web-based learning scenarios. Using a graphical user-interface (GUI) the teachers should be able to choose existing learning-concepts and to realize them by web-based learning. Based on classical models of didactics a class-hierarchy of identifiers for learning-phases, learning-methods and learning-tools was developed, which is already in use by teachers in their practical work. After empirical studies this term set was transferred to scenarios of web-based learning. Didactical templates and patterns are derived. The developed term set and a competency model lead to a class-hierarchy, which is represented by an ontology for the semantic web. This ontological structure in combination with the GUI has to enable the saving, loading and sharing of learning scenarios based on web-standards. Using editors for creating the sets of meta-data and the ontology, this work offers first prototypical solutions. As part of an outlook on further research options for the mapping of the ontological structure into a learning platform are discussed. The aims of this investigation are first solutions to the largely automatic transfer of a planned learning scenario into a course structure of the chosen learning platform.
69656;Discussion of the Competence Management Models for Education Context;The fours model designed to support competence management are presented: the model of knowledge processing in Open and Distance Learning, the motivation model, the model of developing a curriculum oriented on competence acquisition, the model of competence development in an intangible production network. All the models are integrated through common parameters and criterions and are adapted to Digital Economy context. In the paper the approach to models integration is proposed. The models are designed to be implemented in competences acquiring process for knowledge repository development in the distance learning network (DLN). The DLN’s aim is to ‘produce’ the competence required on the job market.
69660;Competence Mining for Collaborative Virtual Enterprise;In a context of decision-aid to support the identification of collaborative networks, this paper focuses on extracting essential facets of firm competencies. We present an approach for enrichment of competence ontology, based on two steps where a novel effective filtering step is utilized. First we extract the correlation between terms of a learning dataset using the generation of association rules. Second we retain the relevant new concepts using an extracted semantic information. The suggested approach was tested on an ontology of mechanical industry competencies. Experiments were performed on real data, which show the usefulness of our approach.
69663;Knowledge-intensive support for product design with an ontology-based approach;To improve product development decisions and to obtain a competitive advantage, an industry should effectively organize, store and retrieve such knowledge and experience. In this study, a knowledge model in product design domain named the Product Knowledge Model (PKM) is identified including four knowledge types, resource description knowledge, organization competence knowledge, product technology knowledge, and business process knowledge, and is expressed in ontology providing a formal conceptualization of a particular domain. A solution for interconnecting tacit and explicit knowledge resource to support designers making decisions on product design is proposed, considering the same domain ontology set for modeling the knowledge items annotations, the user competency profile, and the task context. A knowledge-intensive support prototype system (KSS) is designed and implemented based on the J2EE programming language and platform.
69669;UNICOMP: Identification of Enterprise Competencies to Build Collaborative Networks;In a context of decision-aid to support the identification of collaborative networks, this paper focuses on extracting essential facets of firm competencies. Due to the complexity of the notion of competence, this contribution is based on a semantic representation of information using semantic ontology, bonds and a linguistic treatment based on the utilization of syntactic patterns. To identify enterprise competencies, the UNICOMP system uses company web sites as information source, as well as a general ontology of competencies as semantic resource.
69689;Supporting Self-Regulated Learning;Self-regulated learning (SRL) competences are crucial for lifelong learning. Their cultivation requires the right balance between freedom and guidance during the learning processes. Current learning systems and approaches, such as personal learning environments, give overwhelming freedom, but also let weak learners alone. Other systems, such as learning management systems or adaptive systems, tend to institutionalise learners too much, which does not support the development of SRL competences. This chapter presents possibilities and approaches to support SRL by the use of technology. After discussing the theoretical background of SRL and related technologies, a formal framework is presented that describes the SRL process, related competences, and guidelines. Furthermore, a variety of methods is presented, how learners can be supported to learn in a self-regulated way.
69702;Web-based self- and peer-assessment of teachers’ digital competencies;Although there exist several alternative frameworks and standards for describing the digital competencies expected from teachers, there is a lack of Web-based assessment tools that allow authentic, reliable and valid assessment of these competencies. This paper addresses the design challenges related to a software solution for self- and peer-assessment of teachers’ digital competencies. The empirical part of the paper describes the participatory design process and results from the first user testing of a Web-based self- and peer-assessment tool DigiMina, which supports teachers in building and sharing a personal competency profile. In DigiMina, the competencies are assessed by a teacher herself or by her peers using the performance indicators that are based on the competency model NETS for Teachers created by the International Society of Technology in Education.
69731;Modeling Semantic Context for Active e-Learning in the Workplace;How to improve the competence and productivity of knowledge workers becomes an important task in the knowledge society. Despite the gradually increasing practices of e-learning in the workplace, most of the applications perform poorly in motivating workers to learn and fail to adapt learning materials to the workers’ individual situation, characteristics and needs. Therefore, by encapsulating learning resources as self-represented and evolving learning cells, this paper proposes three types of ontologies for semantic context modeling in terms of personal information, business flow, and social interaction. Based on semantic context, two learning modes, i.e., modular learning and just-in-time learning, are provided to support contextual learning in a more active and adaptive manner. The utility and functionality is illustrated along a real world application scenario at the research and development department of an education technology company.
69743;Skill Modelling for Digital Factories;In the past two decades, the use of ontologies has been proven to be an effective tool for enriching existing information systems in the digital data modelling domain and exploiting those assets for semantic interoperability. Despite the presence of many databases for industrial skills and professions, a formal representation, namely, an ontology, which meets the requirements of an existing tool for skill and capability analysis called CaMDiF is missing. In this research, the MSDL ontology, used by the tool in its initial version, is extended by importing modules of upper level and mid level ontologies (BFO and Agent Ontology) and by developing a new ontology for industry skills and professions based on an existing non-ontological resource (O*NET). As a result, an overview of the enriched data structure is provided along with some discussions on a use case related to skill analysis enabled by the new CaMDiF’s skill modelling features.
69785;An Ontological Approach for Domain Knowledge Modeling and Management in E-Learning Systems;One of the most important tasks in the process of designing educational material for distance learning is the representation and modeling of the cognitive domain to which the material refers. However, this representation should be formal, complete and reusable in order to be used by intelligent tutoring system applications, other knowledge domains or tutors. In the context of this work, we propose a methodology that relies on the notion of ontology so as to represent the knowledge domain. Moreover, this methodology has been applied to the educational material of the Hellenic Open University.
69790;An XML Multi-agent System for E-learning and Skill Management;"E-learning is nowadays recognized as one of the key components of Enterprise Knowledge Management platforms. Given a project specification, the platform should be able to suggest a project team, to measure human resources competence gaps and to contribute to reduce them by creating personalized learning paths. In this paper we propose an XML based Multi-Agent System to perform the following tasks: (i) supporting Chief Learning Officers in defining roles, associated competencies and knowledge level required; (ii) managing the skill map of the organization; (iii) measuring human resources competence gaps; (iv) supporting employees in filling their competence gaps as related to their roles; (v) enriching a given courseware or creating personalized learning paths according to feedbacks user provides in order to optimize the acquisition of needed competencies; (vi) assisting Chief Learning Offcers in choosing the most appropriate employee for a given role."
69795;Key competencies in sustainability in higher education—toward an agreed-upon reference framework;Hundreds of sustainability programs have emerged at universities and colleges around the world over the past 2 decades. A prime question for employers, students, educators, and program administrators is what competencies these programs develop in students. This study explores convergence on competencies for sustainability programs. We conducted a Delphi study with 14 international experts in sustainability education on the framework of key competencies in sustainability by Wiek et al. (Sustain Sci 6: 203–218, 2011), the most frequently cited framework to date. While experts generally agreed with the framework, they propose two additional competencies, suggest a hierarchy of competencies, and specify learning objectives for students interested in a career as sustainability researcher. The refined framework can inform program development, implementation, and evaluation to enhance employability of graduates and facilitate comparison of sustainability programs worldwide.
69796;National Qualification Systems Integration using Ontologies;This work presents the use of ontologies as a way to tackle the problem of integration of qualification systems in order to enable the transparency and mobility of students at European level. For this, qualification systems at post-secondary non-academic levels of nine EU countries have been formalized in terms of profile, activities, competences, learning outcomes, etc., first using UML for a human-readable model and then using OWL for a machine-processable one. In addition, concrete qualification profiles have been used as a case study to check the models’ correctness.
69800;Educating for competence in professional practice;In educating for the professions, teachers seek to enable students to engage in professional practice as competent practitioners. In this paper we question the adequacy of traditional approaches for promoting competent practice. These traditional approaches typically view competence in terms of attributes, such as knowledge, skills and attitudes. Competence development is then seen in terms of acquiring the necessary attributes. From an alternative view of competence as based on ways of experiencing practice, we argue that competence development focus on enriching experience of practice. More specifically, we point out that competence development involves change in the structure of the meaning for practice. Change in meaning structure for practice involves both a significant shift from one way of experiencing practice to another, as well as refinement and elaboration of the way of experiencing practice. Implications of this view of competence development for professional education are discussed. In particular, we deal with implications relating to the teaching-learning relation and the form the educational programme takes. In summay, we argue that enabling students to develop competence through experience of engaging in practice is most closely directed to the aims of education for the professions.
69802;Building Ontology Based Tools for a Software Development Environment;Knowledge has been thought to be the most important asset in an Organization, having a significant impact on its competitiveness. Software development is knowledge-intensive but software development environments lack from specific support of knowledge management. In this paper, we present an enterprise ontology that supports the development of two case tools: an ’yellow pages’ tool that aims to represent the distribution of knowledge, skills and experiences trough the organizational structure and a tool to support human resource allocation planning in software projects based on the reuse of organizational knowledge about human resource skills and allocation. The work is concerned with Knowledge Management and Enterprise-Oriented Software Development Environments concepts.
69807;Embedding Cultural Competence in Science Curricula;Effectively incorporating cultural competence into tertiary institutions is paramount to the creation of cross-cultural settings where undergraduates and academics can develop understandings of how culture and belief systems influence professional decision making. Processes that incorporate cultural competence are viewed as particularly challenging in science disciplines, particularly non-vocational science disciplines where “western? or reductivist ways of teaching and “doing? science remain dominant.
69814;Real-Life Learning in Virtual Communities of Technology;This paper introduces an approach to building virtual communities for Real-life technology learning. The aim is to keep technicians and technologists updated with new advances in their specific technology area. The learning strategy is based on a ‘skills and competences’ pedagogy and the community is built in an adaptive and collaborative information system environment which provides tools for collective knowledge management with adaptive distribution. A methodology for building Virtual Communities for Technology Learning is presented, and the ongoing experience of implementing such a community in a countrywide institution of technology learning in Brazil is also reported.
69815;Self-regulated learning with approximate reasoning and situation awareness;We present a decision support system for seamless and self-regulating learning. The decision support system presents a degree of novelty in supporting learners since it allows to: (1) understand the concepts that a learner may have acquired during her/his daily life activities, and (2) make the learner aware of these concepts and enforcing learning paths. Two key ideas are behind our results. The first idea relates to the identification of classes of indiscernible competences, and comes from the intuition that some real-world activities can lead to the acquisition of sets of competences (not always easy to discriminate) which can be considered as good approximations of competences related to a specific concept. Classes of indiscernible competences are building blocks that our decision support system uses to understand, with a certain degree of approximation, the concepts that a learner may have acquired, and this is an added value with regard to the self-awareness of a learner. The second idea is to allow our decision support system to identify incremental learning situations, which are situations in which a learning path is enforced or modified by the recognition that some concepts may have been learned, also during the execution of daily life activities. The decision support system grounds on three-way decisions and situation awareness. An evaluation of the system following the SAGAT approach has been done and reported in the paper.
69816;Conceptual Framework, Models, and Methods of Knowledge Acquisition and Management for Competency Management in Various Areas;An approach to organizing knowledge acquisition and management (KAM) and an appropriate conceptual framework for wide competency management sphere and other traditional humanities subject domains (SD) are described. The main purpose of the approach is to support possibility of SD experts work not only with the knowledge, but also with the knowledge metamodel without knowledge engineers’ participation. The framework combines methods of knowledge elicitation and description well-known in humanities with formal methods for knowledge modeling. The framework includes the set of principles, a model of multidimensional space for visualization of continuing education (LifeLong Learning Space, LLLS), normalized competency metamodel (NCMM), and the process of NCMM tailoring. LLLS is used as domain-specific KAM goals model and as a tool for intuitively obvious goals visualization. Well-order and partial order relationships defined on LLLS dimensions are used for competency profiles evaluation and comparison. NCMM facilitates KAM process structuring and control. Rules for KAM process support and performance are described. The types of completed projects for more specific domains are mentioned.
69821;Organizational schemata of e-portfolios for fostering higher-order thinking;The information technology of online e-portfolio systems have been widely used during the past several years along with the diffusion of electronic teaching-learning systems. However, for the time being e-portfolio is viewed more as an assessment tool or a showcase tool, but less as an active learning tool. The current generic e-portfolio systems store artifacts in the chronological order on the course basis, providing few facets for active thinking. The question of how we can make e-portfolio a useful learning tool to improve students’ learning outcomes is still open to research. Among various students’ learning outcomes, higher-order thinking has become an important outcome of education. One vision of education evolution is to change the modes of thinking of students. This study is to meet the challenge of e-portfolios by investigating a significant research question: how e-portfolios can be used as a learning tool for students to foster higher-order thinking. Specifically, this study proposes an ontological approach to organizational schema of e-portfolios so that e-portfolios can be logically and dynamically organized into thinking-driven networks. The ontological schemata can serve as visible maps for the virtual e-portfolios repository shared by all teachers and students to foster higher-order thinking. A case study that implements a prototype of organizational schemata of e-portfolios demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach for fostering higher-order thinking.
69829;Ontology-Based Retrieval of Experts – The Issue of Efficiency and Scalability within the eXtraSpec System;In the knowledge-based economy, organizations often use expert finding systems to identify new candidates or manage information about the current employees. In order to ensure the required level of precision of returned results, the expert finding systems often benefit from semantic technologies and use ontologies in order to represent gathered data. Usage of ontologies however, causes additional challenges connected with the efficiency, scalability as well as the ease of use of a semantic-based solution. Within this paper we present a reasoning scenario applied within the eXtraSpec project and discuss the underlying experiments that were conducted in order to identify the best approach to follow, given the required level of expressiveness of the knowledge representation technique, and other requirements towards the system.
69833;Supporting assessment autonomy: How one small school articulated the infrastructure needed to own and use student data;This paper reports the results of an 18-month integrated, problem-solving research study of one new school’s efforts to create a K-12 system of student assessment data that reflects their innovative vision for personalized and student-centered instruction. Based on interview, observational, and documentary data, the authors report how teachers articulate, measure, and assess student core competencies, aligned with a common vision and supported by a technology interface designed to promote data use. Findings from this study add to the research literature on assessment and data use by articulating the necessary knowledge and supports teachers in new autonomous schools need to develop and formatively use student assessment data.
69867;Ontology and Rule Based Inferring on Project Teams;A task of automatic identification of potential project team members based on project requirements and personal competence profiles is a complex one. It requires a good knowledge base together with an adequate knowledge processing engine, capable of inferring on the knowledge available. In this paper, we study and present an approach to implement a knowledge management system with the use of semantic web technologies in combination with a declarative production rule-based system. We used ontologies to represent the needed knowledge and rule-based expert system to infer on the knowledge and to provide the requested results. In this manner we developed a prototype system that should assist in project team building activities.
69878;Towards Automated Education Demand-Offer Information Monitoring: The System’s Architecture;Rapid economic changes in the knowledge requirements for labor cause a necessity to monitor education demand and offer. In this paper education demand and offer information monitoring (EduMON) system is proposed. The system can obtain the monitoring information from unstructured or semistructured textual information sources. The use of the monitoring system in educational institutions can foster study course compliance with knowledge required in job market. In enterprises it can help to evaluate knowledge potential of educational institutions for selecting employees or providing continious education possibilities. Human Resource management systems, job seeking portals, educational institution information systems and other systems could also use the analysis services provided by the EduMON system. Vacancy descriptions and university course descriptions are the main information sources wherefrom the education information in terms of skills, knowledge, and/or competences is retrieved. EduMON architecture accommodates the scope of services starting from the information retrieval to information analysis and presentation. Brief overview of the services is given by describing their basic functionality and implementation considerations.
69884;The Challenge of Learning for Networked SMEs to Increase Competitiveness in Virtual Enterprises;Collaborative Networked Organisations (CNO) face the same if not even harder problems when trying to transform towards a learning organisation. Small and medium sized organisations - which still represent the motor for job creation in Europe - often respond to market turbulence by engaging in non-hierarchical CNOs such as Virtual Enterprises. A proven method to support learning in distributed set-ups is Serious Gaming, but the question remains whether the application of such tools is equally effective in SMEs compared with monolithic large organisations. In SMEs and networks of SMEs learning needs to move towards contextualised learning and a serious gaming based transformative environments such as TARGET can be used to achieve learning goals and competence development in distributed set-ups. This paper introduces such a transformative environment and highlights the background, its usage, benefits and limitations.
69897;Modeling Semantic Competence: A Critical Review of Frege’s Puzzle about Identity;The present paper discusses Frege’s Puzzle about Identity as an argument against a Millian theory of meaning for proper names. The key notion here is semantic competence. Strict notions of semantic competence are extrapolated from a two-sorted first-order epistemic logical modeling of a cognitive neuropsychological theory of the structure of lexical competence. The model allows for a rigorous analysis of Frege’s argument. The theory and model of lexical semantic competence includes a multitude of types of competence, each yielding a different argument, far from all being as decisive against Millianism as has been the mainstream assumption in 20th century philosophy of language.
69943;Aided Virtual Team Building System: Zooming in on Web 2.0 Tools and Competence Management;Our paper responds to the need of an Aided Virtual Team Building System (Aided VTB System). It focuses on virtual teams that are active in virtual design projects in the area of New Product Development (NPD). An extract of requirements of this Aided VTB System is presented that is based on the idea of Quality Function Development and its tool “house of quality?. The fulfillment of the demand of the requirements by appropriate relevant and recent concepts and techniques as solutions is discussed with help of a sample survey of 34 virtual team leaders. One of the outcomes of the Aided VTB System is to provide recommendations, guidelines and even best practices to take a choice of web 2.0 tools and concepts and techniques in the domain of competence management.
69960;Towards a Methodology for Managing Competencies in Virtual Teams – A Systemic Approach;Virtual instruments and tools are future trends in Engineering which are a response to the growing complexity of engineering tasks, the facility of communication and strong collaborations on the international market. Outsourcing, off-shoring, and the globalization of organisations’ activities have resulted in the formation of virtual product development teams. Individuals who are working in virtual teams must be equipped with diversified competencies that provide a basis for virtual team building. Thanks to the systemic approach of the functional analysis our paper responds to the need of a methodology of competence management to build virtual teams that are active in virtual design projects in the area of New Product Development (NPD).
69976;IM-TAG: Informal Mentoring Improved by Means of Social Web Contents Tagging;Corporations are facing an era in which human capital is crucial for their sustainability. In such scenario, personnel development is decisive for both personnel and organizations. On the other hand the importance of social web for business is unquestionable in terms of knowledge management and information sharing. This paper presents IM-TAG, a tool to use web 2.0 contents in informal mentoring processes. This tool is based on the processing of semantic tagging of blog contents as well as opinion tagging made by users. The results of the process are recommendations of mentoring contents built upon personal characteristics of the mentee combined with content and opinion tagging.
69981;Use of RDF for expertise matching within academia;Organisations have realized that effective development and management of their organisational knowledge base is critical to survival in today’s competitive business environment. Employees, as a special knowledge asset, also attract the interest of many researchers because only through people communicating with one another can they really share their tacit knowledge and skills, which are often more valuable than sharing explicit documentations. The need to be able to quickly locate experts among the heterogeneous data sources stored in the organisational memory has been recognized by many researchers. This paper examines the advantages of using RDF (resource description framework) for expertise matching—the process of finding an individual with the required knowledge and skills. The major challenge is to semantically integrate multiple expertise indications from heterogeneous data sources stored in the organisational memory in order to facilitate users to locate the right expert(s). To understand the issues, a case study has been performed that involves building a RDF-based expertise broker that helps Ph.D. applicants locate potential supervisors before they formally apply to a university. An evaluation of the brokering system has been conducted through an experiment and the key results are presented. An extended brokering system that would support expertise matching in a multidisciplinary context is also described and further research identified.
69993;Capability Modelling and Knowledge Management;Organisations are realising how important it is to “know who knows what? and be able to make maximum use of the knowledge. The field of knowledge management is concerned with this issue. AIAI has been involved in the area of knowledge management for some time. AIAI has also been working on ontologies and — in particular — capability ontologies in the context of workflow systems, and is now applying knowledge management techniques to make additional use of the capability ontologies in knowledge management. A software system for supporting capability management, based on a capability ontology and other, well defined specifications, can help an organisation to align the skills of current and future employees with the strategic business objectives.
70036;A Method for Developing Generic Capability Maps;Capability-based management is an approach for strategy formulation and implementation that is rooted within the enterprise architecture discipline and founded on managerial theories. The main instrument of capability-based management is the capability map, which provides a structured and hierarchical overview of an organization’s capabilities. At a sufficiently high level of abstraction, organizations within the same industry or societal sector are managed based on capabilities that can be described using a generic capability map. While industry/sector-specific capability maps are used in consultancy practice, knowledge of how to develop such generic capability maps is lacking in the academic literature. Therefore, the paper addresses the question of how a generic capability map for organizations within the same industry/sector can be developed. Professional sport clubs were used as the application field for the design science research. The research was executed in collaboration with three major, premier league Belgian clubs that operate in the highest tier of their respective professional sport competition. After different iterations of joint development and evaluation activities with these clubs, the final design of a generic capability map was successfully obtained. Through reflection and learning from this process, the paper formulates the procedural knowledge that was gained in the study as prescriptions that can be used as general steps of a method for creating other industry/sector-specific capability maps. This outline of a method for developing generic capability maps is an original contribution to the enterprise architecture discipline.
98747;Project-competent paradigm of knowledge representation of the three-level engineering education system;In many universities of the world, modernization of engineering training programs for engineering activities is carried out using the CDIO approach [1,2]. This approach has become widely used in the countries of near and far abroad and in particular at the Tomsk Polytechnic University of the Russian Federation. As noted by head of the Department of engineering pedagogy of the University, Doctor of Technical Sciences, Professor A.I.Chuchalin [3,4], the approach provides a framework for the design of multi-level programs of engineering education, is relevant in connection with the requirements of international standards for learning outcomes in higher education institution and the competences of professional engineers[5]. The CDIO approach provides the opportunity to form optimal structures, content and technologies of implementation and quality assessment of level engineering education programs. It is known that any profession is based on a certain set of theoretical knowledge and practical experience. If this framework is formalized and properly documented, such a body of knowledge can be a starting point for developing layered training programs for specialists, as well as for accrediting academic programs and professional certification. Recently, the term ontology has become common in the information technology literature. In the works Gavrilova T.A., Subetto A.I., Khutorskoy A.V., Tsukanova N.I. [6,7,8,9,10,11], applications of ontology, as domain models, the development of a knowledge base of intelligent systems, the use of an ontological approach to knowledge management based on the competence approach, and also methods for developing educational and methodical complexes based on ontology are considered. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

98762;Ontology-Based Analysis and Design of Educational Games for Software Refactoring;Despite being regarded as necessary to ensure a system’s maintainability and extensibility, software refactoring is often neglected in practice due to difficulties and risks perceived by software developers. Still, refactoring received little attention by software engineering education and training so far. Educational games are a popular means for enhancing practical competences as well as increasing motivation of learners. For instructors, however, it is challenging to develop and apply games in order to address certain learning objectives, which is important to integrate the games into existing or planned training paths. In this article, we propose an ontology that aims to support the analysis and design of games for teaching and training software refactoring. In particular, we create a unifying domain ontology bridging core concepts from three related fields, i.e. game design (a), software refactoring (b), and competence management (c). The resulting ontology is represented as a UML class diagram that reflects concepts and concept relations important for educational refactoring games. We describe ontology-based design options and demonstrate the use of the ontology by analyzing existing games for software refactoring. In addition, we also present an exemplary process for developing novel games based on the ontology and illustrate its applicability by designing a non-digital card game. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
98774;Aspects of Requirements Elaboration to Basic Competences of a Personality in the Digital Economy Environment;The rapid development of digital economy influences the society in general and ordinary life of a human particularly. Rapid changes are challenges for the system of education. They course the problem of elaborating the system for basic competences of a personality that would provide person with a possibility of fast adaptation to social and economic changes and also their successful socialization, professionalization and well-being under the conditions of digital economy. The article focuses on methods that allow constructing of a possible relevant model of requirements to basic competences of a personality in the environment of digital economy in the system of the adaptive control of professional education quality – the educational framework of qualifications. The proposed methods for determining the content and levels of competencies have been successfully tested in the development of requirements and evaluation of the results of formal education. The article is aimed at researchers who are dealing with the problem of adaptive control of the quality of human resources and with results of formal and informal training. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
98785;Identification of Dependencies Between Learning Outcomes in Computing Science Curricula for Primary and Secondary Education – On the Way to Personalized Learning Paths;The multitude of curricula and competency models poses great challenges for primary and secondary teachers due to the wealth of descriptions. Defining optimal (or personalized) learning paths is thus impeded. This paper now takes a closer look at 7 curricula from 6 different countries and presents an approach for the identification of learning outcomes and dependencies (requires and expands) between them in order to support the identification of learning paths. The approach includes different strategies from natural language processing, but it also makes use of a refined and simplified version of Bloom’s Taxonomy to identify dependencies between the learning outcomes. It is shown that the identification of similar learning outcomes works very well compared to expert opinions. The identification of dependencies, however, only works well for detecting learning outcomes that refine other learning outcomes (expands dependency). The detection of learning outcomes which build on each other (requires dependency) is, on the other hand, still heavily dependent on the definition of dictionaries and a computing science topics ontology. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
98788;Ontologies - facilitators for curriculum design in centers of excellence for engineering education;Ontologies are engineering artefacts which reduce conceptual and terminological confusion by providing a unified framework for describing the concepts of the world and their relations. Thus, they improve communication and cooperation between people and organizations. Also, ontologies are cross-platforms, cross-applications, thus they are facilitators for software interoperability, and they provide reusability, reliability, specification. In e-learning, ontologies are used to improve personalization, search and retrieval, learning domain description, learner profile modelling, feedback implementation, assessment, but also curriculum modelling and management. In this paper, we focus on this last-mentioned application of ontologies. In curriculum development, ontologies foster the transparency, collaboration, exchangeability and interoperability, support the alignment, classification, comparison, and matching between universities, educational systems or relevant disciplines, help in managing the educational offerings of an institution, revealing useful information like course overlapping, uncovered or less covered areas, possible synergies between courses, support course recommendation. Besides highlighting the best practices of ontologies in curriculum development (e.g. the Bologna Ontology, the BBC Curricula Ontology or the CCSO ontology), we propose an ontological model for curriculum design in centres of excellence in engineering education developed within the Erasmus+ Capacity Building EXTEND project and underline the possible advantages brought by them in the network of centres - knowledge transfer between centres in different countries and regions, exchange activities between those centres, double graduation certificates and so on. Also, our proposed ontology contains the competences which are considered necessary results for a teacher training program in engineering education within EXTEND framework and facilitates the interrogation of the curriculum via dedicated SPARQL queries. © 2019, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

98792;Towards the Technology of Employers’ Requirements Collection Development;The article demonstrates the results of the research, which studied the effectiveness of organizing a proper connection between companies and universities. A methodology of employers’ requirements collection and evaluation is given. To get information about the requirements, it is proposed to analyze the open vacancies of companies. The technology for reviewing, extracting and systematizing requirements from the description of employers’ vacancies was created in order to use the gathered information in university Learning Management Systems. It is suggested comparator identification method as a basis for mechanism of vacancies description search, data retrieval, an indicator value transformation, and comprehensive assessment performing. It is proposed the model of requirements collection based on the method of comparator identification. The ontology of employers’ requirements can be used for requirements collection, analysis and estimation. However, there is still a problem of requirements thesaurus creation, vacancies, and features for different specialties in different languages. Description of vacancies in IT sphere is unified enough worldwide. But we cannot say the same about all other areas of industry. That’s why thesaurus of equivalent terms and their translations have to be created. Future work will be directed on the implementation of the suggested approach in the domain of IT specialists. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.
98809;Pandemic learning ontology: Methodological aspects to assess skills in a public health emergency;The purpose of this work is to show the experience of methodological aspects which were used to assess competencies with regard to conceiving, designing, implementing and operating (CDIO), in a curriculum for competencies in the face of state of emergency in public health due to coronavirus. The situation and advances are displayed as a case study, in training civil engineering professionals in computer science at the Catholic University of Temuco (CUT) in Chile. The questions intented to be resolved are: Is it possible to improve the capacities of students from the Araucanía region (Chile) in a social-economic-cultural system, through teaching and learning based on education which allows them to discover, expand and exploit the improvement of the training of professional human capital with competencies in an emergency situation in public health due to coronavirus?. The process of validation of competencies responds to conceive, design, implement and operate (CDIO) being adapted. The way in which the transition in the levels of competencies that the progressing student advances occurs is achieved in different teaching and learning activities through online training. The implementation of competency validation is produced in different contexts in the phases: conceive, design, implement and operate, which have had to be faced by teachers, instructors, assistants for the achievement of students. © 14th IADIS International Conf.

98811;Ontological model of representation of university resources;"The article substantiates the expediency of using the ontological model of presentation of knowledge, which combines the properties and advantages of other models of presentation of knowledge and data in the process of construction, development, processing and application of ontologies. The analysis of application of systems of computer ontologies has been analyzed and the criteria of their selection are selected: software architecture and tools development; functional compatibility; intuitive interface. Determined to be the most optimal with regards to the training of future pedagogical engineers in the field of computer technology Protege OWL. The requirements, which are put in the process of designing an ontological model of representation of educational resources of the university, are singled out. The ontological model of representation of university resources used for unified description of knowledge bases from the point of view of competency requirements (knowledge, skills, skills) to student learning outcomes with the possibility of constructing repositories of electronic and educational resources was designed. The set of concepts and set of relations of computer ontology are presented. The method of filling the ontological base of knowledge of educational resources of the University is proposed. Experimentally, the efficiency of using the proposed ontological model for representing the University's learning resources in the process of training future engineers-educators in the field of computer technologies has been proved by the indicators: speed of construction under ontologies; number of defects. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

98817;Validation of a semantic search engine for academic resources on engineering teamwork;"Obtaining evidence on the acquisition of the teamwork competence, from students throughout their training, is demanded by both accrediting agencies of High Education degrees and future employers. This competence has been, and still is, of great importance in general and in degrees in engineering in particular. Based on previous research studies, evidence to evaluate teamwork competence acquisition is classified in three dimensions: (i) the individual dimension, acquired by each team member; (ii) the group dimension, composed of results from each teamwork; and (iii) the result dimension, which consists of deliverable products throughout the teamwork process. One of the methods which takes the three dimensions into account, the one that helps train and evaluate the teamwork competence, is the ''Comprehensive Training Model of the Teamwork Competence'' method. In this paper, we will show that through this method, more than 50 teams have generated evidence which can be used as learning resources. All this evidence has been stored and organized (through an ontology) in a semantic repository. The generated evidence is retrieved by using an inference engine through the metadata of ontology. This study, which has validated the resources obtained from the repository, was relevant for a specific information demand. To this end, results automatically obtained by the search engine were compared with those manually found by teachers who are experienced in the teamwork competence. © 2020 TEMPUS Publications."
98833;Competence Mining to Improve Training Programs;Analysing of competence and skill shortage or surpluses is essential for educational institutes to prepare their students for satisfying labour market needs in time and comprehensively. Currently, changes in labour market needs are influenced by not just economical but also technological factors. ICT and digitalization play key roles in transformations of business processes including employees’ competences in executing these processes smoothly and effectively. Our research goal is to develop a competence mining method to identify and extract competences needed to fill job vacancies. Based on this new information the educational programs can be refined. This paper presents how to use business process models to extract competences from job vacancies and how this method evolved in time and what its contribution is to the training development based on learning outcome. Competence concept has a crucial role in this method, but it is defined on a broad scale that causes terminological diversity. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
98839;Even Better than the Real Thing: Practice-Based Learning and Vocational Thresholds at Work;This chapter considers the distinctive contribution of practice-based learning to New Zealand’s vocational education system. It contends that examining the way apprenticeship-like arrangements combine theoretical knowledge and practice competence is particularly useful for addressing questions about the kinds of knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed for 21st life and work and how they are best developed. The chapter draws on research with general practice (GP) registrars, carpentry apprentices, engineering technician cadets, and their workplace teachers and mentors, exploring “vocational threshold? experiences that act as a portal to new levels of practice capability (Vaughan, Bonne, Eyre, Knowing practice: Vocational thresholds for GPs, carpenters, and engineering technicians. Wellington, New Zealand Council for Educational Research and Ako Aotearoa, 2015). The vocational thresholds that learner-practitioners must cross – developing expertise with uncertainty (GPs), reframing technical know-how with craft values (carpenters), and developing a social eye (engineering technicians) – are notably dispositional in nature. This underscores the critical role of ontology (nature of being), as well as epistemology (nature of knowing), in capability development. The chapter argues that this makes the inherently integrated approach of practice-based learning apposite for a knowledge society requiring attentive, proactive, and wise practitioners. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.
98844;Integrating social media into an instructional design support system;This paper is the result of a collaboration between the University of Genoa and Middle East Technical University Northern Cyprus Campus about the enhancement of a recommender system that supports academics to integrate social networking and Web 2.0 tools for language education. Starting from a survey about current usage of social media in education and language teaching, the paper describes the extension of the L-Max Ontology to support teachers in building learning activities using Twitter, in relation to specific competences to be developed, specific learning goals and contextual constraints. To test the extended version of the recommender we performed a mockup evaluation based on the L-Max Ontology. © 2017 ACM.
98856;Ontological design to support cognitive plasticity for creative immersive experience in computer aided learning;This paper discusses Ontological Design (OD) to support creative and insightful thinking in the increasingly customised modern world, specialised for augmented reality interfaces. The motivation was built upon IBM’s suggestion that capitalising complexity enables creativity, and the latter is the single most important leadership competency to deal with the increasing world complexity. Thus, OD simplifies the customisation processes and reduces anxiety when comes to challenging digital literacy for computer aided learning (CAL) skills. In a mixed reality modern world learners need to constantly adapt to changes into information, knowledge, signification and meaning, skills and competencies. This requires or enables cognitive plasticity bringing back the initial educational target, learning to learn. OI is based on the mediated ways the tools are used to enhance our senses and mind and the interaction as well as the influence our world view. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.
98865;Six scenarios of exploiting an ontology based, mobilized learning environment;In this article, six different exploitation possibilities of an educational ontology based, mobilized learning management system are presented. The focal point of this system is the educational ontology model. The first version of this educational ontology model serves as a foundation for curriculum development and adaptive knowledge testing. The extended educational ontology model is the foundation of a personnel selection and training system, developed by the OntoHR project. This system reveals the candidates' competence gap and the missing learning outcomes of their qualifications in the light of a particular job role (Information System Analyst). Within the frame of the Contsens project, the educational ontology model supports a context sensitive and location based learning content delivery. The results of these projects can be combined in an educational ontology based, mobilized selection and learning management system, built on transparent content and location dependent curricula.

98874;Adaptive guidance for disciplinary competencies self-learning using an educational hypermedia;"Our work is at the crossroads of educational adaptive hypermedia and the competency based approach. Adaptive Hypermedia Systems (AHS) are based on a domain model and a learner model to provide a virtual hypermedia to the learner. To achieve the interconnection between the domain representation and a virtual hypermedia, different techniques are used. We are particularly interested by the technique of direct relationship that allows building the structure of the virtual hypermedia by associating to each concept of the discipline one or more physical pages of the virtual hypermedia in one hand. In the other hand, each of the semantic links between the discipline concepts corresponds to hyperlinks in the virtual hypermedia. The AHS have already proven their usefulness in the context of self-learning of subject knowledge in the case of objective based pedagogies. We propose here to use them in the context of self-learning of disciplinary competencies. Indeed, we suggest an AHS that generates a guide map of the disciplinary competencies with all the other connected concepts to study according to the semantics of the discipline defined by the domain ontology in the background of the disciplinary knowledge base and the learner's profile. This last is deduced from the learner's model where we put mainly three classes of parameters: cognitive ones that define the state of knowledge particularly the respective performance level for each competency, resolved problem situation..., type of intelligence which defines a learning style, preferences and identification parameters. The disciplinary competencies domain ontology used to generate the AHS domain is designed around these main concepts: disciplinary composed competency, disciplinary elementary or granular competency, contextualized problem situation, potential obstacles, potential instructions ... Also; we have semantic relations including the prerequisite relationship and the composition one. A prototype was developed to test the feasibility of the dynamic generation of the guide map for the case of first level relational databases learning where a knowledge base was generated from the proposed domain ontology. After that, the prototype was tested with a group of students from our university. The results were interesting."
98876;Conceptual design of a tool for personalized and context-based learning on the job;An appropriate use of media is a key success factor for communicating information efficiently in educational and professional context. The vocational education and training community would benefit from tools that foster media usage both from trainee and teacher / trainer perspective. Aspects like co-creation and information sharing influence collaboration in the web. Hence, competence-related knowledge is crucial to use media in an efficient way. This paper presents a domain ontology and the conceptual design of an assistance system which fosters an efficient use and reuse of media content in professional context by receiving recommendations about appropriate media usage.
98877;Modeling semantic context for active e-learning in the workplace;How to improve the competence and productivity of knowledge workers becomes an important task in the knowledge society. Despite the gradually increasing practices of e-learning in the workplace, most of the applications perform poorly in motivating workers to learn and fail to adapt learning materials to the workers' individual situation, characteristics and needs. Therefore, by encapsulating learning resources as self-represented and evolving learning cells, this paper proposes three types of ontologies for semantic context modeling in terms of personal information, business flow, and social interaction. Based on semantic context, two learning modes, i.e., modular learning and just-in-time learning, are provided to support contextual learning in a more active and adaptive manner. The utility and functionality is illustrated along a real world application scenario at the research and development department of an education technology company. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.
98879;Knowledge graph: Semantic representation and assessment of innovation ecosystems;Innovative capacity is highly dependent upon knowledge and the possession of unique competences can be an important source of enduring strategic advantage. Hence, being able to identify, locate, measure, and assess competence occupants can be a decisive competitive edge. In this work, we introduce a framework that assists with performing such tasks. To achieve this, NLP-, rule-based, and machine learning techniques are employed to process raw data such as academic publications or patents. The framework gains normalized person and organization profiles and compiles identified entities (such as persons, organizations, or locations) into dedicated objects disambiguating and unifying where needed. The objects are then mapped with conceptual systems and stored along with identified semantic relations in a Knowledge Graph, which is constituted by RDF triples. An OWL reasoner allows for answering complex business queries, and in particular, to analyze and evaluate competences on multiple aggregation levels (i.e., single vs. collective) and dimensions (e.g., region, technological field of interest, time). In order to prove the general applicability of the framework and to illustrate how to solve concrete business cases from the automotive domain, it is evaluated with different datasets. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.
98887;Model of linking organization goals to employee competence management for formal and non-formal education providers;This paper presents an approach to describe the impact on competence management in organizations under the assumption that all competence management should be goal-oriented and serve the organization’s interests in reaching the goals. Ontology-based model is proposed to represent the interaction of goal setting and competence management. The related concepts of the model are described introducing development goals as a link between organization goals and competence management. The algorithm for integration of competence management into goal setting is proposed. The paper also explores the possibilities for formal and non-formal education providers to provide competence management linked to goal setting as a process of double-loop learning to help organizations become learning organizations.

98888;A model for skills and competences and its application in the agricultural sector;"The evolving needs within the European learning and employment landscape set clear and mature requirements for the combination and integration of European policies and metadata standards towards a European Competence Model that will be able to support technology enhanced learning, training and employment, thus increasing mobility, and employability opportunities for European citizens. Starting with generic domain modelling, the eCOTOOL project provides formal structure for representing skills and competences distinguishing between and responding to the needs of two important user groups: those whose work relates to vocational education and training (VET) or employment; and those who build the tools. This paper presents and explains the ""high-level competence model"" that works on paper for general professionals, the ""technical"" competence model that provides the ontological foundation for effective interoperable tool-building, together with the methodology and rationale followed. In addition, it discusses the model's exploitation and usage in instruments like the Europass Certificate Supplement (ECS), a European paper format for presenting the skills and competences acquired through VET, providing concrete examples for the field of agriculture. © 2011 Springer-Verlag."
98889;Knowledge acquisition and learning process description in context of e-learning;This paper investigates the problem of design of e-learning and MOOC systems. It describes instructional design-based approaches to e-learning systems design: IMS Learning Design, MISA and TELOS. To solve this problem we present Knowledge Field of Educational Environment with Competence boundary conditions - instructional engineering method for self-learning systems design. It is based on the simplified TELOS approach and enables a user to create their individual learning path by choosing prerequisite and target competencies. The paper provides the ontology model for the described instructional engineering method, real life use cases and the classification of the presented model. Ontology model consists of 13 classes and 15 properties. Some of them are inherited from Knowledge Field of Educational Environment and some are new and describe competence boundary conditions and knowledge validation objects. Ontology model uses logical constraints and is described using OWL 2 standard. To give TELOS users better understanding of our approach we list mapping between TELOS and KFEEC. © 2017, American Institute of Physics Inc. All rights reserved.

98911;An ontology-based recommender system to support nursing education and training;The need of healthcare organization on highly knowledgeable and qualified human recourses to guarantee quality of performance is indispensable. A desired performance level is tailored with obtaining competences and job knowledge, as the major influential factors. This is especially critical due to high rate of changes in knowledge domains and technological infrastructure over time i.e. before or within employment of job holders and applicants. Therefore, applicants as well as employees and practitioners are also dealing with upgrading their level of job knowledge and qualifications. Adaptive Medical Profession Assessor (Acronym: Med-Assess) as a European funded project, proposes a knowledge based system for assessment of the competences and job knowledge of the applicant/employee to perform a certain job role in the domain of healthcare i.e. nursing and care giving to neuro-patients. In this context, recommendation of learning materials is an integral part. It subjects to the required training due to the lack of competence(s) for performing a specific nursing task(s). This paper presents the system architecture of Med-Assess, and discusses how the applied semantics i.e. ontologies and rules are developed. It especially presents the background in nursing education and training, and conceptually presents the design of the recommender components. © LWA 2013 - Lernen, Wissen and Adaptivitat, Workshop Proceedings.

98913;Using agents and open learner model ontology for providing constructive adaptive techniques in virtual learning environments;Typically, the existing resources in Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), used in distance education courses and blended, are presented in the same way for all students. This may not be useful for effective learning of each learner. Faced with this problem, this paper presents a strategy that allows content adaptation to students in VLEs based on a constructivist approach, using multi-agent system technology manipulating an open learner model ontology comprised of several learner characteristics, such as their competencies, skills, equipment which the learner uses, performance on activities, frequency and learning styles. The leaner model is dynamically changed during the course, through the interactions of the student with VLE. Moreover, this model is shown to the student, with the aim of student to know their current status in the course. Results obtained in a Numerical Analysis discipline show the feasibility of the proposal. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.
98915;Mathematical models of learning materials estimation based on subject ontology;Two mathematical models are under consideration in this paper: the ontology usage as a tool of automation has become popular nowadays. There are comparisons between the subject ontology’s part and students’ cognitive map which are being developing during the test. It gives a possibility to assess student’s knowledge skills as well as some new characters of the educational outcomes. The core competencies form the basis of the student’s ability to learn, as well as interdisciplinary concepts or metaconcepts. The first and second sections of the article present a subject ontology model. The third section is devoted to metaconcepts testing based on metasubject’ ontology. In conclusion we formulate our main results and prospects of its development. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.
98916;STSIM: Semantic-web based tool to student instruction monitoring;In this article, a tool so-called STSIM is presented. It is able to monitor the student's progress along learning experiences. This tool, based on semantic web, allows students and teachers to monitor the knowledge student state including, among others, the learning objective state -achieved and not achieved- in different types of activities with psychomotors, cognitives or affective competences, and the efficiency accomplished in activity execution to facilitate the tutor or student the supervision of learning in a more adaptive way according to the individual characteristics and student knowledge state in each moment. To achieve this goal, STSIM uses a flexible student model supported by an ontology network, the Student Ontology. The tool has been developed to be multiplatform, multilingual, based on current and open-source web technology and characterized by its usability. STSIM is built on the UML-based web engineering (UWE) methodology and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
98927;Model of intangible production network for competence development;In the knowledge-based economy intangible production (de-materialised production) plays the main role. Intangible production is an advanced manufacturing process performed on the information level, where input materials, semi products and final products are in a digital form. The production network consists of nodes, each of which performs processing of information and knowledge through collaboration with other nodes. The paper focuses on the kind of intangible production where the production process utilizes different types of knowledge and competence is the final product. The educational organizations and distance learning are a good example of this type of the intangible production. In the paper a model of intangible production network for competence development in the context of educational organization is discussed. The proposed approach can be used to develop and manage knowledge-base systems on the level of ontology. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.
98928;A semantic Recommender System for iDTV based on educational competencies;Interactive Digital Television (iDTV) provides a large amount of educational programs useful for supporting students’ learning and teaching processes. Nevertheless, despite the continuous growth of the number of available contents, it is hard to find those which can be useful for a specific educational purpose. In order to provide a solution to this issue, in this paper we propose a model of a semantic Recommender System for educational iDTV programs, in which, the concept of competency and its features have been integrated as contextual information to enhance both the user and program information. Thus, we can establish filtering strategies in accordance with educational requirements. Furthermore, this proposal incorporates ontologybased filtering to enhance the inference capacity of another approaches, such as, content-based, collaborative, and syntactic matching. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.
98930;An ontology-based E-learning framework for healthcare human resource management;Human resources management is an essential prerequisite to enhance performance in healthcare organizations. Improving human resources management in a university hospital, first and foremost depends on how professional and knowledgeable the management team is, as well as on the competences and skills of its members. This paper describes a highly personalized e-learning system, which is able to take into account the individual's profile, learning style, initial knowledge and education needs. The system is based on new technologies: Semantic Web and ontologies. On these technologies are based the development of the constituent parts of the system: the student model, the model of the field of interest namely Healthcare Human Resources Management (HHRM) in Romania. The main benefit of the proposed e-learning method consists in personalized training of managers. The characteristic feature of the suggested method largely lies in the fact that specific ontologies of the field of interest are implemented with the Protégé environment which relies on a personalized methodology. The paper presents the constituent parts and architecture of the proposed ontology-based e-learning system and a framework for its implementation in a real life platform. Even though the current system is tailored to the needs of HHRM, its application could be extended to other fields of knowledge and learning contexts. © 2017, All Rights Reserved.
98946;Learning personalization design solutions in an e-learning system;"This article describes some theoretical and practical aspects regarding the process of personalizing services and content for an e-learning environment, issued within the national research project ""Innovative System for Personalized and User-centered Learning with Application to Project Management (SinPers)"" developed by the National Institute for R&D in Informatics, the Academy of Economic Studies and the Project Management Association Romania. This project proved that the learning personalization needs innovative solutions for three main domains: the design of the teaching-learning process (actors roles, activities structure and flow, events and conditions specification), the creation and maintenance of an individual model for each learner (goal, preferences, knowledge level, learning results) and the structuring and accessing mode of the educational digital content (based on domain and competences ontology, learning objects, metadata)."
98953;Using a competence model to aggregate learning knowledge objects;Competence-based learning models have great importance for learning resources: they constitute a meaningful structure for just-in-time and just-enough learning. In this paper, we present an ontology-based competence model that allows the on-the-fly generation of Learning Knowledge Objects (LKOs). The automatic aggregation process relies on knowledge objects and ontologies created through text mining and natural language processing. It is guided by instructional theories encoded declaratively through SWRL. Our framework offers a constructivist learning approach through the presentation of the LKO's context to the learner based on domain ontology. Finally, it allows the standardization of the generated learning objects in SCORM and IMS-LD. © 2007 IEEE.
98956;An evaluation of generated question sequences based on competency modelling;In order to support lifelong learning, assessment systems have to focus on representation and updating a variety of knowledge domains, rules, assessments and learner's competency profiles. Adaptive assessment provides efficient and personalised routes to establishing the proficiencies of learners. Existing adaptive assessment systems are faced the challenge of dealing with inconsistently measuring and representing student's knowledge. We can envisage a future in which learners are able to maintain and expose their competency profile to multiple services, throughout their life, which will use the competency information in the model to personalise assessment. This paper presents an adaptive assessment system based on a competency model. The system automatically generates questions from a competency framework and sequence the questions based on the taxonomies of subject matter or of capability, making it possible to guide learners in developing questions and testing knowledge for themselves. The questions and their sequencing are constructed from a given set of learning outcomes and the subject matter recorded in an ontological database. The architecture of the system and the mechanism of sequencing the questions are discussed.
98985;The ELEKTRA ontology model: A learner-centered approach to resource description;There is little doubt that intelligent and adaptive educational technologies are capable of providing personalized learning experiences and improving learning success. Current challenges for research and development in this field concern, for example, the design of comprehensive data models for adaptive systems as well as the interoperability of systems and the re-usability of learning material across different systems. In the present work we introduce an ontology model, basically developed in the context of immersive digital games, which attempts to provide a solution to existing problems in resource description. On the one hand, comprehensive data models for adaptive systems are supported by separating static information from adaptive systems as far as possible. On the other hand, the ontology model offers a potential solution to precise and, above all, learner-centered resource description by separating latent competencies from observable performance (in learning objects or test items). © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
98998;The Influence of Descriptive Language Practices on the Process of External Integration of Corporate Knowledge;The article assesses the role of accounting for implicit knowledge in creating corporate knowledge management systems and describes specific approaches to formalizing tacit knowledge based on an educational competence approach using a separate assessment of academic competencies and background knowledge of employees. Particular attention is paid to the issues of the need to ensure multilegality in the description of knowledge elements and their unifying structures. The paper shows that a significant part of the procedures for automated extraction and formalization of corporate knowledge is based on technologies for working with natural language and assumes that the corporate semantic knowledge structures created at the same time, generated based on the company's production documents and employees’ educational programs, are based on the concepts and structures of the language of primary documents. This leads to a complication of the conditions for integrating such a monolingual corporate knowledge management system with semantically structured information about accumulated knowledge objects and the relationships between them, combined using Knowledge Graph technology. The paper concludes that corporate knowledge, regardless of its origin, can be detected and explicitly described with the help of enriched ontologies, using universal methods of statistical and contextual analysis of arrays of corporate documents, and using multilingual types of representation of basic concepts. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
98999;Ontology-based learning content recommendation;A new era of e-learning is on the horizon, hundreds of learning contents are created and more and more people begin to acquire acknowledge through e-learning. The traditional teaching method is already showing its limitations that students from different backgrounds are still given the same contents at the same time, and they may only interest in part of a whole learning content. In this paper, we propose a novel way to organise learning contents into small 'atomic' units called learning objects so that they could be used and reused effectively. The learning objects together with their ontology are systemised into knowledge base. An intelligent recommendation mechanism based on sequencing rules is then introduced with detail, where the rules are formed from the knowledge base and competency gap analysis. Finally we establish a test knowledge base system, using and extending the ontology editor Protégé-2000 and its Protégé Axiom language. Copyright © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.
99004;A personalized and collaborative elearning materials recommendation scenario using ontology-based data matching strategies;We propose a virtual teacher for the evaluation of students' competencies. It aims to improve learning by making personalized suggestions on the learning materials. It is based on three main components: 1) a semantically enriched content management system (CMS), playing the role of knowledge base, 2) a 3D anatomy browser and 3) an ontology-based matching strategy called Controlled Fully Automated Ontology Based Matching Strategy (C-FOAM), providing the evaluation methodology. Together with the collaborative knowledge base, which allows knowledge to be represented in natural language and to be further reused, the evaluation methodology becomes the main contribution of the paper. The approach is demonstrated on a learning scenario illustrated around 3D anatomical structures. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
99010;The educational system and the competency-based approach: Towards a formalization of the approach;In response to the increased social pressure on the goals of teaching, Morocco has decided to adopt the competency-based approach. This reform intends to remedy the inefficiency of its educational system, to improve the quality of training and, therefore, make profit of its investment in education on all levels. Motivated by a strong desire to create the necessary conditions for the various contributors in this reform, so they could adopt this approach effectively, we propose a formalism that will make explicit all the implicit practices of the 'competency' in the learning in class and in e-learning, and that will facilitate the conceptualisation and the implementation of this approach. The conception of a domain ontology seems to be the appropriate solution to reduce or even eliminate the conceptual and terminological confusion and ensure a shared understanding to improve communication, sharing, interoperability and reusability. © 2009 IADIS.
99017;Knowledge based systems for planning learning outcomes in manufacturing engineering;"In engineering education there are increased needs for life-long-learning and individual qualification planning. Student mobility is on the rise, and there is pressure to implement more efficient methods in teaching and educational quality management. Innovative solutions for a more transparent representation of qualifications, therefore, will play a key role in achieving the necessary changes. In the education market learning outcomes (LO) give an explicit value to a currency which is, in this case, the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) and the European Credit Point System for Vocational Training (ECVET). Until now the utilization of standardized LO has not achieved acceptance in the European Higher Education (HE) Market. There are certain issues which might be causing resistance. Some might not consider instructional activities as products with comparable features. Some might not know how to apply LO. Many are struggling with the complexity and diversity of information that arises when LO from various courses are created and brought together. A further analysis and evaluation of accreditations or curriculum planning is especially laborious. If LO are regarded as threshold standards of the students' ability to perform a particular task at the end of a formal learning activity, then they can be seen as a binding product feature. A LO representation, which is based on a shared concept, facilitates reliable comparisons of teaching activities within the market for higher and further education. Semantic web technologies can process distributed data and manage a high degree of complexity. By means of formal ontologies, they can give meaning to the teaching contents, learning processes and performance levels expressed in course descriptions and qualification frameworks on the web. This enables stakeholders in the educational market to analyze information about instructional activities more efficiently. The challenges dealt with in this paper are the creation of a shared conceptualization of LO and the generation of corresponding metadata. A support-software that generates course descriptions and automatically annotates the descriptions is presented. It assists the teacher in creating LO, which are both didactically adequate as well as readable by humans and machines. This requires a shared competence model and a representation language for LO, to establish a consistent understanding of proved qualifications. The paper presents how the competence model is conveyed in an ontology. The use of the course description generator and the creation of a knowledge base are shown in the example of the International Masters Program ""Global Production Engineering"" (GPE) at Technische Universität Berlin, Germany. This builds a foundation for various software applications which can support the mobility of learners in an international framework, the modularization of education, the ability to plan learning paths in curricula, and the scalability of qualification profiles and frameworks."
99029;Model of a collaboration environment for knowledge management in competence-based learning;In the article the authors propose a model of an educational social agents collaboration between students, teacher, and an e-learning information system (repository). The system will support the competence-based learning process by means of social network creation in order to exchange ontology in the repository environment. The proposed model consists of three integrated sub models: (i) knowledge management model, (ii) student - e-learning information system - teacher interaction organization model (iii) model for quantity assessment of collaboration. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.
99032;CADDIE and IWT: Two different ontology-based approaches to anytime, anywhere and anybody learning;The Semantic Web seems to offer great opportunities for educational systems aiming to accomplish the AAAL: Anytime, Anywhere, Anybody Learning. In this scenario, two different research projects are here introduced: CADDIE (Content Automated Design & Development Integrated Editor), developed at the DIST of the University of Genoa, and IWT (Intelligent Web Teacher), developed at the DIIMA of the University of Salerno, each of them characterized by the use of ontologies and semantic technologies in order to support instructional design and personalized learning processes. The former aims to develop a learning resources and instructional paths authoring tool based on a logical and abstract annotation model, created with the goal of guaranteeing the flexibility and personalization of instructional design, the reusability of teaching materials and of the related whole knowledge structures. The latter represents an innovative e-learning solution able to support teachers and instructional designers to model educational domains knowledge, users' competences and preferences by a semantic approach in order to create personalized and contextualized learning activities and to allow users to communicate, to cooperate, to dynamically create new content to deliver and information to share as well as enabling platform for e-learning 2.0.
99059;Allocation of Human Resources in Sustainable Production Context;The idea of sustainable production, among many others, takes into account the aspect of work, in particular the role of man in the production process. In addition to the need to provide the employee with a sense of well-being, this issue also has economic significance: in many situations, the time and quality of task implementation depends on soft competences, e.g. creativity, learning skills, openness to change, flexibility, knowledge based on experience. In addition, selected skills are important when performing certain jobs, e.g. spatial planning skills, a sense of aesthetics, and the set of such skills needed is different for different jobs. However, the selection of employees for tasks, especially in the case of a large variety of tasks performed (e.g. in services, maintenance provided for many plants) is not easy. It requires prior recognition and assessment of employees’ soft competences and proper recognition of the requirements that a specific task presents to the employee. Only then, it is possible to select the teams that carry out the tasks correctly. As the complexity of production processes increases in industrial enterprises and the need to make decisions about the allocation of employees to tasks based on real-time information arises, the problem described is becoming increasingly important. In the article, authors present the original concept of a tool supporting the process of selecting employees for tasks of various nature. The possibility of using selected analytical methods to determine the soft skills of employees and an advisory system supporting the determination of the desired soft skills needed for the task was presented. Solving these two problems will then allow developing a tool to support the scheduling work of employees. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
99061;The use of ontologies in the development of a mobile e-learning application in the process of staff adaptation;The article discusses the method of using ontologies for developing a mobile application of the corporate e-learning system in the process of adaptation of companies’ new employees. The problems of shortening the period of adaptation of newly recruited employees force companies to look for effective methods of personnel management, their training and development. Well-known publications and the best developments in the field of mobile devices in corporate training systems, which allow to determine the vector of development of corporate training systems from e-learning to mobile learning, were considered. The widespread use of mobile devices makes the process of learning and adaptation of employees flexible, convenient, which leads to reduction of the time for employees to join the company's business processes. The problems of motivation and staff engagement in the process of early adaptation remain, but they are solved in the course of our other studies. The original method is use of ontologies when building individual learning paths in the process of adaptation of employees. The article examines the main approaches to the presentation and analysis of employees’ competencies based on ontologies when building modern corporate systems of adaptation and personnel training. An original approach to creating mobile applications is proposed, which reduces the time for adaptation and training of new employees. © BEIESP.
99074;Standardization of Education Content for Future Engineers Based on Ontologies (by an Example of Railway Transport);An increase in volume and complexity of engineering knowledge in the digitalization of high technology and knowledge-intensive industries including railway transport constantly raise the level of employers’ entry requirements for competences of their future employees. While recognising the potential of an ontological approach to modernise engineering education, many researchers comment that ontology-based education technologies are still insufficiently used in university practice. The primary novelty of this article lies in a number of conceptual provisions supported by the authors. Firstly, the content of education courses within engineering education programmes should be standardised through ontologies at the level of concepts and their relations. Secondly, subject ontologies harmonised with the standards for physical objects through a system of similar concepts can be considered as standards in the development of education courses. Thirdly, the ontological model of an education course has certain advantages over traditional formats for content representation (text, hypertext), as it is more systematic and available for a process of critical re-thinking. Fourthly, an education course ontology establishes the method of forming a system of professional concepts among future railway engineers. In order to translate the idea about standardisation of an education course via its concepts and relations into practice, a piece of ontology for the Artificial Intelligence Systems Course has been developed. The top-down method was applied to construct this ontology. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
99078;Ontological Analysis of Outcomes of Non-formal and Informal Learning for Agro-Advisory System AdvisOnt;Agricultural advisory systems are widely used now for fast dissemination of agricultural knowledge and information, introduction of modern scientific research and technologies in production, mobility and constant advanced training of agricultural specialists. Their implementation becomes an important factor in competitiveness of rural economy. We consider advisory systems used by various countries and regions, their specifics and aims, and knowledge bases that can be used as bedrock for agro-advisory applications – the European Multilingual Classifier of Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations ESCO ontology, ontologies of learning resources (on example of MOOCs), user profile ontologies. Analyses of the intelligent Web-oriented informational technologies shows an expedience of advisory development based on the Semantic Web standards of knowledge representation and processing. An important factor of advisory efficiency deals with semantic documentation and validation of non-formal and informal learning outcomes typical for agriculture. We propose semantic advisory system AdvisOnt based on ontological representation of knowledge about competencies, vacancies, training courses, user profiles, employers and companies. AdvisOnt services match available vacancies and applicant profiles to recommend employment or further learning of wanting competences by analysis of their formal, non-formal and informal learning outcomes. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
99114;Ontology for corpus of occupation and competency standards;The ability of personnel in the field of information and communication technology varies greatly, in line with the emergence of various formal and informal educational institutions in this field. Increasing the capabilities and competencies of Human Resources in accordance with the demands of the global labor market needs a reciprocal relationship between the providers of Human Resources and the industrial world in need. There are many occupations in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) field, each occupation has several competencies. Each occupation has more than one competency. The many occupations and competencies, in Indonesia, are grouped under the name Occupation Map and Competency Standards (CS). The first thing to do is review the Occupational Map document and Competency Standards (CS) document. The results of the analysis of the two documents produce elements that can be used to build ontologies. So that based on this, in this study a method was developed to produce ontology from Occupational Map and Competency Standards (CS). The results obtained from this study are the Occupational Map ontology and Competency Standards (CS) ontology. The ontology concept of the Occupational Map and Competency Standards (CS) can be used as the basis for making the Occupational Map corpus and the Competency Standards (CS) corpus. The Occupational Corpus and Competency Standards (CS) Corpus can be used by governments, private companies or industry when making job vacancies information or looking for prospective employees and that can be used to see the suitability between occupation and competence. © 2021 Little Lion Scientific
99154;Features of development and use in the educational process of nrnu mephi tutoring integrated expert ystems in the field of study «software engineering»;"The purpose of this work is to show some methodological aspects of software engineering, reflecting the departmental view that has developed over the years on issues of training specialists in the field of PT, and also highlight and briefly characterize modern innovations that are currently used for practical implementation of the educational process on the basis of the ontological approach and the use of tutoring integrated expert systems (IES) to support basic courses / disciplines. The formation of the modern scientific and educational appearance of the department in the field of PT is naturally associated with the historical, conceptual and technological integration of three specializations (“Computer Software?, “Intelligent Systems and Technologies? and ""Automated Information Systems"") within the “Software Engineering? training area, which is reflected in the creation of a single ontological space of knowledge and skills on the basis of which, using the technology of teaching IES, competence-oriented models of graduates were constructed. The ontological approach integrates heterogeneous knowledge, data, documents (FSES standards) and others allows you to effectively organize the educational process in the field of ""Software Engineering"" using the most modern technologies in the development and use of intelligent systems of various classes. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

99164;Development of ontology model of requirements to results of training in system of adaptive control of education quality;The problem of a quality assurance of management of education systems regarding establishment of requirements to results of training by modern science is solved in line with ambiguously treated competence-based approach. Within this article authors consider the possibility of creation of such system based on ontology model. The benefit of this method of the problem resolution is possibility of harmonization of requirements, both for employers, and from representatives of the educational community. It is described as tools of research of data domain and the course of creation of this model, and results of its use for development of a frame of qualifications of professional education of the Ural region and a frame of qualifications for the IT industry.
99196;SCALE: A competence analytics framework;This paper introduces SCALE, a Smart Competence Analytics engine on LEarning, as a framework to implement content analysis in several learning domains and provide mechanisms to define proficiency and confidence metrics. SCALE’s ontological design plays a crucial role in centralizing and homogenizing disparate data from domain-specific parsers and ultimately from several learning domains. This paper shows how SCALE has been applied in the programming domain and reveals systematically how the work content of a student can be analyzed and converted to evidences to assess his/her proficiency in domain-specific competences and how SCALE can also analyze the student’s interaction with a learning activity and provide a confidence metric to assess his/her behavior as he/she culminates toward goal achievements. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.
99208;Platform for computer-aided harmonization of informatics curricula;This paper presents a new platform aimed at improving informatics teaching by computer-aided harmonization of the standardized secondary school informatics curriculum and curricula by which teachers of informatics are educated. The platform relies on competency based curricula ontologies and the harmonization method based on ontology alignment. The secondary school informatics curriculum ontology was built to comply with the ACM K12 standard, while the teachers’ curriculum ontology was built based on selected existing curricula, due to the lack of explicit standardization in the field. A task-specific method for curricula harmonization was developed that relies on standard ontology alignment algorithms. The prototype software tool was implemented and used by independent experts to verify the proposed method, by investigating compliance of the standardized secondary school informatics curriculum and the domain (informatics) segment of the teachers’ curriculum. © 2016, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

99209;Patching bits won’t fix vocational education in Australia–a new model is needed;"Australia’s vocational education and training (VET) qualifications comprise units of competency that are bundled together in qualifications and nestled in training packages developed for particular industries. This article argues that this model is broken and cannot be fixed by patching bits of the system. Competency-based training (CBT) is based on an atomistic ontology that results in the fragmentation of knowledge and the atomisation of skill. CBT underpins a fragmented VET system with thousands of qualifications. It facilitates a market that has resulted in: thousands of private providers; the erosion of technical and further education (TAFE) institutions as the public provider; the transfer of unprecedented amounts of public funding to private profits; and, scandals and rorts. The same atomistic ontology underpins VET qualifications, the VET system and the VET market. The article concludes by briefly discussing an alternative model of qualifications using the capabilities approach. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
99212;Modelling an adaptive e-learning system for implementing competencies-based approach;"Our objective in this work is to propose an adaptive e-learning system permitting to implement the competencies-based approach. This approach aims to develop learners' skills in order to get them used to problem situations meeting their learning path. It provides solutions to the objectivesbased approach's limits by offering to learners integration situations allowing them to mobilise and use pertinently what they have learned, which will allow them to establish links between the acquired concepts and create its global and significant representations. To ensure our system's functionalities, we have conceived a multi-layer, multi-ontologies and cooperative multi-agents architecture. Briefly, our solution is designed to address the main challenges: 1) develop learners' skills using customised learning activities; 2) exalt the learning desire of learners; 3) propose to learners in difficulties appropriate remediation paths. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
99214;Innovative paradigm of education of knowledge –competency form based on ontology;The article describes an innovative methodology for shaping educational components of a planned training, based on ontology of reference concepts of educational content and an algebraic model of knowledge mapping - expression of knowledge on the basis of which subjects of the foundation and major-specific courses curriculum should be designed. The main purpose of the proposed methodology is to create knowledgeable content of the semantic database to design teaching and methodological materials for courses curriculum. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.
99271;Supporting cognitive competence development in virtual classrooms: Personal learning management and evaluation using pedagogical agents;Self-directed learning with learning management systems can be intelligently supported and enriched using available log data in combination with detailed competence ontologies. The approach described here implements a mechanism to adaptively generate quizzes for self-assessment in a Moodle environment. The underlying agent architecture uses a tuple space in the role of a blackboard. The approach has been worked out with a distance course on Genetics. © 2010 IEEE.
99272;Semantic enhancement of the course curriculum design process;In this paper we propose a methodology intended to improve Course Curriculum Design (CCD) tasks, using for this purpose Semantics and CBR techniques. In specific, our proposed methodology is focused on two points: (i) the re-use of available resources (courses, etc), and (ii) the application of the experience of different experts in the course creation. As a prove of concept, we present a case study where our methodology is applied for competence and course creation using the Spanish normative for vocational education domain (technical degree). © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.
99299;Project management competences development using an ontology-based e-learning platform;The paper presents a web based learning environment in project management, capable of building and conducting a complete and personalized training cycle from the definition of the learning objectives to the assessment of the learning results for each learner. This paper focuses on the organization of the learning content according to the course ontology developed by the author. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.
99310;SCOWT: Semantic competencies for worker training;"Organizations globalization is becoming more and more usual in IT sector. Currently, teams composed by members from different countries and collaborating with other foreign teams is a growing tendency. However, this multicultural working environment carries remarkable problems due to linguistic and cultural issues. These problems arise not only in software development stages but also in information exchange between organization departments. The Human Resources (HR) department is one of those departments that suffer from ambiguous vocabulary while understanding concepts like, e.g, ""competence"" or ""skill"". We propose a Competence Management Ontology (calledSCOWT), inspired by Semantic Web technologies, Linked Data principles and the European e-Competence Framework for ICT professional competencies definition. This ontology has been designed as the key component for the development of a Competence Management System. Using ontologies will raise the current level of semantic interoperability of data exchange between HR departments and could improve efficiency of HR activities, specifically the training activities design in a global IT organization. © 2011 IADIS."
99311;Knowledge framework supporting semantic search of learning resources;This chapter reports on a practical application of semantic technologies for retrieving learning resources. While most existing Learning Objects Repositories offer textual based search which fails in retrieving adequate resources if the words used in the query and in the metadata do not match, the proposed approach is entirely relying on several ontologies. Two use cases in industrial and academic contexts show how core ontologies based on LOM and competencies approach could be combined with specific representations to enable retrieving more resources better fulfilling learners' needs. © 2009 Springer US.
99317;A training path advisor for lifelong learning;The need for lifelong learning is increasing, especially in an ever-changing work environment, which requires employees to acquire new knowledge and skills. The Hong Kong Qualifications Framework (HKQF) is a model of competency, which matches various types of qualifications to a clear definition of competency standards in different professional areas. We developed a prototype of web-based training path advisor for project management under such a framework. The system describes the HKQF in ontology and suggests personalized training path with suitable courses to learners based on a learner's competency level, training history, and training goals.
99336;An ontology-based data matching framework: Use case competency-based HRM;As part of the European PROLIX (Process Oriented Learning and Information eXchange) project, VUB STARLab designed a generic ontology-based data matching framework (ODMF). Within the project, the ODMF is used to calculate the similarity between data elements, e.g. competency, function, person, task, and qualification, based on competency-information. Several ontology-based data matching strategies were implemented and evaluated as part of the ODMF. In this article we describe the ODMF and discuss the implemented matching strategies.
99338;Competence management in e-learning systems: A possible approach;The need expressed by the single individual in a lifelong learning context is to have a personalized training able to facilitate the reaching of specific competences, to take into account not only the knowledge but also the sector-based skills. This explication has led the Polo di Eccellenza L&K research group to define an innovative Competence Management model. This model has been obtained from an extension of the Knowledge Model used by the e-learning platform Intelligent Web Teacher. It is, in fact, the result of the combination of the Domain ontology, underlying the IWT Knowledge Model, with an Application ontology according to the meaning used by Paquette (2007) in his vision.
99343;An ontology-based approach for modelling grid services in the context of e-learning;A technique for developing e-learning grid services is presented in this paper, which adds to the current Open Grid Service Architecture (OGSA) certain facilities for ontology accessing. We consider services for developing a user competence profile by referring to domain ontologies to express competences, and also services for learning objects' ontology-based annotation. To specify the resources and services stored by a grid system, the existing semantic web models, languages and technologies are considered. This approach enables an improvement of personalisation services. Copyright © 2008 Inderscience Publishers.
99345;An ontology-based competence management model to support collaborative working and organisational learning;"This chapter describes an ontology-based competence management model that can be used to support distributed collaborative working and facilitate organisational leaning. The chapter begins by examining the concepts of collaborative working and organisational learning in the context of knowledge management and competence management systems. It describes the different forms of knowledge that can be represented in such systems and uses this to describe an ontology-driven approach to competence management. An outline design for an ontology-driven competence management system and the related content management approach is then outlined using material from earlier work on a group memory system; the competence ontology and expert annotation technique used in group memory system is described in detail. The chapter concludes with some discussion concerning the role of such systems in knowledge-intensive industries and some directions for future research. © 2007, Idea Group Inc."
99347;Using ontologies for representation of individual and enterprise competence models;Awareness of competence and structured competence representations are important elements in different business scenarios such as a company looking for a partner with expertise in a certain industrial sector or new staff member with particular skills. This paper presents the use of ontologies to formally represent competence models describing individual and enterprise competences. The individual competences model includes the three major parts: general competence, cultural competence, and occupational competence. The enterprise competences model consists of two parts: industrial competence and occupational competence. The competence models are defined with a meta-model, the latter being an ontology language. Particular individuals and enterprises are described with competence profiles, which are instances of the models. During a pilot study, five individual competence profiles and four enterprise competence profiles were built. The approach to competence modeling has proved to be able to capture capabilities of individuals with diverse occupational and educational backgrounds. Furthermore, the competence modeling approach proved to be suitable for enterprise competences in different countries due to use of international standard classifications as a basis of the models. © 2006 IEEE.
99360;The specification of competency questions: An ontological support to match business processes, IT and competences of professionals;The need of facing continuous changes in Information Technologies appears particularly demanding for the common knowledge base of firms and competences of professionals. Information Technologies (IT) within business processes need to be linked with the required set of competences that a professional can mobilize. In order to identify the competences activated along with a change in organizational processes, where IT support large part of the routines, this study introduces a structured procedure. It combines the activities and the IT involved in an organizational process with the competences that a professional is required to apply in that situation. The proposed procedure captures knowledge from experts to create a dictionary of IT competences of professions which are matched with organizational processes and technologies. In order to manage data about competences, this study designs an ontological framework which acts as a reference with different practical applications. For instance, in universities, it could be useful in the implementation of study programs to follow a problem-based learning approach. In firms, it can enable several human resource management activities, as selection and training programs. Additionally, it can be useful for design particular competences sets that define curricula of human resources. This study aims to show the specification of the competency questions, which is an acknowledge technique to offer an ontological support to the procedure. The competency questions, formulated in natural language, with their respective answers, drive the development of the intended ontology, and delimit its scope. Competency questions are the starting point to identify the terminology that will constitute the classes and their relationships in the intended ontology. A case study about the identification of IT competences of Industrial Engineering profession is presented as an example of the proposed procedure. This practical case explains how the procedure conceptual model supports the rationale behind the competency questions, which are defined in interviews with experts. Results are discussed in order to address the next steps of the proposed procedure.
99365;Learning resource referencing, search and aggregation at the eLearning system level;TELOS is a new eLearning system being built within the Canadian LORNET project. TELOS aims to provide an open operating system in which users can develop and use eLearning and knowledge management resources and environments within a service-oriented and ontology-driven framework. A special emphasis is put on the aggregation of resources through a graphic scenario editor and the referencing of the resources using a knowledge and competency representation. We advocate that this approach is necessary for federated search or harvesting tools to be well integrated and find meaningful learning resources that need to be repurposed and aggregated, taking in account the diversity of technologies, pedagogical intent and referencing schemas.
99372;Using visual guidance and feedback based on competence structures for personalising e-learning experience;In this paper a novel approach is presented how visualisation of knowledge and competence structures can be employed in order to support personalisation in e-learning systems. Information visualisation strategies are used to present ontology-based domain knowledge and related competence structures to the learner. In contrast to adaptive e-learning systems which employ domain and user models for the adaptation and personalisation strategies, the learner uses these visual knowledge maps to decide on the own learning process. Furthermore, visual knowledge maps are used to give feedback to the learner about learning progress and assessment result. Methods and techniques are presented how these maps can be used for visual guidance and feedback. A set of learning tools have been developed which implement and demonstrate the proposed approach.
99373;Experiences of using an ontology-based knowledge testing approach in teaching business informatics;Competition between Higher Education Institutions is increasing at an alarming rate, while changes of the surrounding environment and demands of labour market are frequent and substantial. Universities must meet the requirements of both the national and European legislation environment. The Bologna Declaration aims at providing guidelines and solutions for these problems and challenges of European Higher Education. One of its main goals is the introduction of a common framework of transparent and comparable degrees that ensures the recognition of knowledge and qualifications of citizens all across the European Union. This paper will discuss an ontology based model that supports the creation of transparent curricula content (Educational Ontology) and the promotion of reliable knowledge testing (Adaptive Knowledge Testing System). The Educational Ontology addresses establishing relation between the requirements of labour markets and the content of curricula through competencies that can be acquired during a given training program. Another critical aspect of this research concerns with the measurement of knowledge. In this respect some possibilities of adaptive knowledge testing will be demonstrated, too. The testing system is the outcome of research of fourteen higher education institutions in Hungary. In order to demonstrate how to use the system in practice, concrete examples will also be described (e.g.: conceptualization of 'Knowledge Management' curricula in the ontology). The adaptive knowledge testing system has already been tested by the participating institutions and their students and these experiences will also be summarized.
99376;Deriving ontologies using multi-agent systems;"The complex systems are designed using multi-agent concepts. Agent interaction is complex and requires appropriate models for a communication and cooperation. Also the interaction between the users and the system agents must be done in an efficient way. One of the basic conditions is that to use a convenient ""language"", a common way of understanding. The ontology is the appropriate concept that allows doing it. The operations on the ontologies cover many of such requirements. Due to the complexity of systems interaction that has an impact on the different ontologies used in them. Our model tries to define a specific operation deriving an ontology form another one. The competence descriptions in education are given as an application. The research for this paper has been partial supported by the project PN II 91-047/2007."
99379;Personalising learning through prerequisite structures derived from concept maps;Current developments in Web-based learning are especially focusing on personalising learning by adapting the learning process to the student's prior knowledge, learning progress, learning goal, and possibly further characteristics. For creating personalised learning paths and efficiently uncovering the knowledge or competence level of a learner, prerequisite structures on learning objects and assessment problems, or on skills underlying those entities, are extremely useful. Knowledge Space Theory and its competence-based extensions provide a sound mathematical psychological framework that is based upon such prerequisite structures. Concept maps or semantic networks representing domain ontologies offer a valuable source of information for establishing prerequisite structures. This paper outlines approaches on the use of concept maps for deriving prerequisite relations and structures, which can subsequently serve as a basis for implementing personalisation and adaptivity in Web-based learning. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
99392;Providing multimedia recommendations based on a Markov decision process inside e-learning platforms;In this paper we provide a solution for recommending multimedia materials inside an e-learning platform, which considers the binding of user profile information with document annotations via the exploitation of domain ontologies. The user profile is structured on three levels - competences, interests and fingerprints - all expressed through ontological constructs, as also the multimedia materials annotations are. The user current activity (his fingerprints) is supervised in terms of conceptual ontology navigation (which ontology concepts are related to the currently accessed materials). For establishing the suitable topics for being recommended at each moment, a Markov decision process is used.
99403;A competency-based learning resource retrieval process: The LUISA-UHP case-study;The paper describes a global framework enabling competency-based search of learning resources making a heavy use of semantic technologies. First it presents the generic components. Then it exemplifies how this framework can be adapted to a given environment, i.e. which knowledge representations, Web Services descriptions and other components have to be tailored or added to the framework. Then it shows step by step how a query is processed, Finally, users' feedback, lessons learnt and future trends are provided as well as comparisons with other approaches already published about annotating and retrieving learning objects in Learning Objects Repositories. © 2009 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.
99408;Competency based management: A review of systems and approaches;Purpose - Aims to review the key concepts of competency management (CM) and to propose method for developing competency method. Design/methodology/approach - Examines the CM features of 22 CM systems and 18 learning management systems.

Originality/value - Emphasizes the beneficial attributes of CM for private and public organizations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
99411;A competence management system for universities;We present an information system for storing, evaluating and reasoning about competencies of students at universities. The system is based on a fine-grained representation of skills and a competence ontology. The system supports students in planning their courses by performing a gap analysis and by producing competency profiles for job applications. The representation of profiles is based on HR-XML in order to enable an exchange of data. Referenced competencies are defined in an ontology and the presence or strength of a competency can be testified by evidences. One possible evidence described in the paper is an explicit measurement. If owners (the students) enable the access to a profile, recruitment and other companies may use these profiles to find appropriate candidates for job vacancies. Due to the sensibility of stored data we use an encrypted XML data store.
99413;Educational ontology and knowledge testing;The Bologna declaration aims at providing solutions for the problems and challenges of European Higher Education. One of its main goals is the introduction of a common framework of transparent and comparable degrees that ensures the recognition of knowledge and qualifications of citizens all across the European Union. This paper will discuss an ontology-based model that supports the creation of transparent curricula content (Educational Ontology) and the promotion of reliable knowledge testing (Adaptive Knowledge Testing System). Beside the description of the evolution of the Educational Ontology, which has beendeveloped within a research project by the Department of Information Systems, role of the ontology in managing, mapping and sharing the knowledge of curricula will be discussed in details as well. The Educational Ontology addresses establishing relation between the requirements of labour markets and the content of curricula through competencies that can be acquired during a given training program. Another critical aspect of this research concerns the measuring of knowledge. The second part of the paper will focus on the possibilities of adaptive knowledge testing and describes how a suitably elaborated ontology model can support adaptive testing of students by enabling a detailed exploration of missing knowledge and knowledge areas.
99416;Towards a human resource development ontology for combining competence management and technology-enhanced workplace learning;Competencies as abstractions of work-relevant human behaviour have emerged as a promising concept for making human skills, knowledge and abilities manageable and addressable. On the organizational level, competence management uses competencies for integrating the goal-oriented shaping of human assets into management practice. On the operational and technical level, technology-enhanced workplace learning uses competencies for fostering learning activities of individual employees. It should be obvious that these two perspectives belong together, but in practice, a common conceptualization of the domain is needed. In this paper, we want to present such a reference ontology that builds on existing approaches and experiences from two case studies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.
