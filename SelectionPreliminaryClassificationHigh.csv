362;Competence Theory and Research: A Synthesis ;
12393;An Ontology for Personalization in Serious Games for Assessment;Serious Games have been widely used in learning, more specifically and more recently for stealth assessment of competencies. To guarantee a reliable assessment outcome, it is essential to keep on an engaging flow in the game, with the right balance between challenge and entertainment. This requires the adaptation of the game content, scenarios and difficulty level to the various profiles, portfolios, learning styles and gameplay style of the assessed players. In this paper, we propose an ontology to model player experience and its association with in-game personalization. On one hand, we use segmentation to define groups of players and we map them to various game changes and adaptations. On the other hand, we link games to academic programs objectives by expressing which competencies required by a given program are assessed by which set of game scenarios. Using our proposed ontology, we define a set of reasoning rules to propose to each player only those games that are tailored for her/his assessment path and player experience.
12397;Towards a context-aware personalized formative assessment in a collaborative online environment;Assessment is a critical component of any teaching-learning process. It is the only way to gain a better understanding of the knowledge and abilities of the learners, especially in a collaborative learning environment. The learner must pay special attention to interactions and real-world context when selecting collaborative situations and activities. As a result, it is critical to ensure that assessment methods and techniques are adapted so that the learning process is better suited to each group of learners, with their unique learning style, background, needs, previous experiences, and most importantly, context. This paper addressed two major issues in the development of a personalized formative assessment system that will be used to assess the knowledge, skills, and competencies of individual and group learners in an online collaborative learning environment. One approach is to design an adaptive assessment path that helps learners achieve specific learning goals based on previous learner performance, level, and context. The other is to make a personalized recommendation using a Context-Aware Recommender System (CARS), which monitors group formation while performing collaborative assessment activities. To formalize and well define our proposed system, we suggest a semantic web approach using ontologies and eLearning standards, CMI5 to describe the proposed assessment path, and IEEE PAPI for the learner model, all of which allow data reusability and interoperability.
12399;Semantic Formative E-Assessment for Project Management Professionals;The paper presents the module for formative e-assessment in a complex learning management system. The module implements the automatic evaluation of answers to open questions and provides feedback related to further reading or joining suitable expert communities. The evaluation of the questions is accomplished using diverse ontology-related technologies and open-source tools, such as GATE, WordNet, Text2Onto, OpenNLP, Jena API, Alignment API, ProtÃ©gÃ©. A use-case scenario is offered for trainees willing to obtain a project management professional certification. The challenges of integration and optimal exploitation of such a module into a learning management system are underlined, stressing the fact that the mapping between concepts which have to be evaluated through assessment and professional competences standards has not currently a straightforward solution. Thus, we could say the system-based solution we envisioned is both technology-driven and need-driven: based on combining recent semantic technologies, it satisfies the experts' urge to provide competency-based learning aligned to well-established standards which reflect the market requirements and the trainees' need of having an intelligent tool helping them to prepare for open-questions based exams, which are currently less supported by IT.
12439;Ontology-Based Model Sustaining Competence Management within Corporates: Competence Certification in CSR;Modern technologies, the increased requirements of the market and the search for a combination of efficiency and quality assurance that have led to the emergence of new ways of organizing production, have had substantial repercussions on the level of skills, knowledge and the capabilities of human resources. This paper proposes an approach that improves the standards related to the competence certification of human capital in order to comply with the principles of Corporate Social Responsibility through ontologies.
12442;Using a Competence Model to Aggregate Learning Knowledge Objects;Competence-based learning models have great importance for learning resources: they constitute a meaningful structure for just-in-time and just-enough learning. In this paper, we present an ontology-based competence model that allows the on-the-fly generation of learning knowledge objects (LKOs). The automatic aggregation process relies on knowledge objects and ontologies created through text mining and natural language processing. It is guided by instructional theories encoded declaratively through SWRL. Our framework offers a constructivist learning approach through the presentation of the LKO's context to the learner based on domain ontology. Finally, it allows the standardization of the generated learning objects in SCORM and IMS-LD.
12452;Supporting Cognitive Competence Development in Virtual Classrooms - Personal Learning Management and Evaluation Using Pedagogical Agents;Self-directed learning with learning management systems can be intelligently supported and enriched using available log data in combination with detailed competence ontologies. The approach described here implements a mechanism to adaptively generate quizzes for self-assessment in a Moodle environment. The underlying agent architecture uses a tuple space in the role of a blackboard. The approach has been worked out with a distance course on Genetics.
12483;Towards Semantic Web-based competence management: Going beyond the limits of traditional competence management;In knowledge society organizations as well as individuals publish relevant data about themselves in the Web. However, still most Web content is only suitable for human consumption. It is not machine-understandable. In this paper, we have restricted ourselves on publishing machine-understandable competence-oriented data in the Web. Such data allows the development of new and more strengthen solutions for collaborative competence management. We present relevant data infrastructures and technologies for such collaboration. In particular, we introduced the notion of Competence Collaboration Domain for data sharing, and the notion of Semantic Profile for representing competences in machine-understandable way.
12490;Towards Guided Personal Learning Environments: Concept, Theory, and Practice;Guided Personal Learning Environment concept (gPLEc) is a novel PLE-building methodology which seeks to fulfill emergent learning needs of a learner through incorporating teachers' guidance element in learners' PLE-building activity. Using Social Semantic Web (SSW) and Recommender System (RS) technologies the gPLEc integrates teachers' PLE-based learning competencies and learners' social web and interaction history data to generate personalized recommendations for each learner. The results, achieved so far, confirm importance of teachers' guidance element for successful implementation of the PLE vision. The expected outcome of this exploratory research is to gain knowledge to construct personalized elearning systems.
12507;Semantic Web Technology as a Tool for Integrating Training and Job Market Supply Chains;For some time now, the training and valorisation of human capital has served as a fulcrum in the strategies of the European Union, in light of its key role in the knowledge economy. Nowadays, the term competence refers to the accumulated outcomes of a variety of learning paths undertaken throughout people's lives. This paper presents a 'traceability' system which uses the ontologies in order to assist universities in the mid-to-long term mapping of the competences acquired by its human capital and to verify that the latter is correctly placed in the job market.
12635;The Opportunities of Cloud Computing for Managing Competences and Learning Paths in Pharmacy;The role of competence management in pharmacy is increasing all the time as healthcare is a field where the fast development of drug treatment and the introduction of new drugs require specialized skills and knowledge that need to be renewed frequently. However, there are two obstacles for the widespread adoption of computer aided competence management in pharmacies. First, pharmacies, as well as most SMEs, do not have enough resources for maintaining competence management systems. Second, pharmacy is a field where well functioning competence management requires co-operation between pharmaceutical organization, healthcare authorities and educational institutions. The problem in co-operation is twofold: (i) the competence descriptions and terminology are not uniformly understood between these organizations, and (ii) the competence management systems do not support co-operation. In order to solve the resource problem, we have exploited a community cloud, which is appropriate in supporting communities that have shared concerns. Further, in order to carry out the co-operation of relevant parties, we have developed a competence ontology that specifies shared terminology, and which makes up a shared data store for the co-operating parties.
12648;Increasing Adoption of Smart Learning Content for Computer Science Education;Computer science educators are increasingly using interactive learning content to enrich and enhance the pedagogy of their courses. A plethora of such learning content, specifically designed for computer science education, such as visualization, simulation, and web-based environments for learning programming, are now available for various courses. We call such content smart learning content. However, such learning content is seldom used outside its host site despite the benefits it could offer to learners everywhere. In this paper, we investigate the factors that impede dissemination of such content among the wider computer science education community. To accomplish this we surveyed educators, existing tools and recent research literature to identify the current state of the art and analyzed the characteristics of a large number of smart learning content examples along canonical dimensions. In our analysis we focused on examining the technical issues that must be resolved to support finding, integrating and customizing smart learning content in computer science courses. Finally, we propose a new architecture for hosting, integrating and disseminating smart learning content and discuss how it could be implemented based on existing protocols and standards.
12651;Designing Customisable Data Science Curriculum Using Ontology for Data Science Competences and Body of Knowledge;Importance of Data Science education and training is growing with the emergence of data driven technologies and organisational culture that intend to derive actionable value for improving research process or enterprise business using variety of enterprise data and widely available open and social media data. Modern data driven research and industry require new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. The education and training of Data Scientists requires multi-disciplinary approach combining wide view of the Data Science and Analytics foundation with deep practical knowledge in domain specific areas. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple form, also providing sufficient data labs facilities for practical training. This paper discusses approach to building customizable Data Science curriculum for different types of learners based on using the ontology of the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) developed in the EU funded Project EDISON and widely used by universities and professional training organisations.
12655;Towards an Ontology for Smart City Competences;Smart cities are complex ecosystems that use information and communication technologies for helping their citizens and organizations to face the challenges of urbanization, safety, resilience, and sustainability. The SmartDevOps project proposes a framework aiming to address the shortage of professional skills in municipalities. Following the increased use of AI methods to provide recommendations in training, there is also an increased need for formalization of existing courses to enable recommendations. This work is dedicated to the conceptual formal modeling of the delivered courses for gaining the competences required for smart city professionals by following the SmartDevOps methodology. We present the Smart City Competence Ontology (SCCompO) that provides a formalism for modeling concepts like competence, learning objective and outcome of courses that aims to cooperate with MOOC platform for training of Smart City professionals. It follows the modular, extensible structure of the curriculum, and it is designed to respond to questions regarding prerequisites and outcomes of job profiles, competences, and courses. The impact of using the developed ontology is to augment the MOOC platform by providing reasoning on course selection and their learning outcomes as well on the relations among these concepts in order to make decisions about the learnersâ€™ curricula.
12658;A Model and a Method for Assessing Students' Competencies in e-Learning System;This article discusses a model and a method for assessing students' competencies in e-learning system, verification of fulfillment of the educational program goals and formation of a graduate with competencies set as a goal at the entrance. It also offers assessment at the level of a discipline, a module and verification of the achievement of the educational program goals.
12668;Personalizing Access to Learning Networks;"In this article, we describe a Smart Space for Learningâ„¢ (SS4L) framework and infrastructure that enables personalized access to distributed heterogeneous knowledge repositories. Helping a learner to choose an appropriate learning resource or activity is a key problem which we address in this framework, enabling personalized access to federated learning repositories with a vast number of learning offers. Our infrastructure includes personalization strategies both at the query and the query results level. Query rewriting is based on learning and language preferences; rule-based and ranking-based personalization improves these results further. Rule-based reasoning techniques are supported by formal ontologies we have developed based on standard information models for learning domains; ranking-based recommendations are supported through ensuring minimal sets of predicates appearing in query results. Our evaluation studies show that the implemented solution enables learners to find relevant learning resources in a distributed environment and through goal-based personalization improves relevancy of results."
12676;Ontological Search for Academic Resources;"Active methodologies promote students' elaboration of knowledge-based resources susceptible to being used as a learning tool. However, due to their quantity, variety and the technology used, it is difficult to manage them, mainly as regards the consultation and identification of the most appropriate resources to carry out a specific training action. A possible solution would be to develop (1) a repository that offers an overview of all resources generated, regardless of the technology, variety and types; (2) an ontology, which permits their classification; and (3) a semantic search system that allows a user to make a quick and effective retrieval. This research-based paper shows the results obtained using a content manager, which centralizes the resources created by the students in some technologies. Also, two tools have been developed: an ontology, which permits resources of a subject to be classified, and a plugin for WordPress, which allows the ontologies are building through the use of tags and categories, as well as to provide them with a semantic search engine through inferences between ontology-related elements---. Through a result cross-check, students' perception of the repository use has been measured. It has been found that, on the one hand, the system proposed is adequate to manage the resources generated by the students; and, on the other, their availability has been useful for them."
12677;The Computing Ontology: Application in Education;Working Group 3 at ITiCSE 2007 continued the ongoing work of the Ontology of Computing project. The working group brought several new people into the project and addressed areas of the ontology of particular interest to these participants. In particular, the group worked on the Ontology sections related to History of Computing, Computing Security and Social and Ethical issues. With the intention of applying the ontology to the support of curriculum development in mind, the group also reviewed and discussed proposed means of presenting a visual representation of the ontology. There was also some work on the present structure of the ontology and future possibilities.
12682;Ontological Model for the Semantic Description of Syllabuses;The syllabus is a relevant document to organize how the teaching-learning process will be carried out during an academic course in Higher Education Institutions (HEI). Usually, this document is written in a human-readable format that do not enable automatic processing through intelligent services to support teaching and learning. Therefore, we created OntoSyllabus ontology for the representation of syllabuses applying the NeOn methodology. The semantic model of a syllabus will allow the comprehension for both: machines and humans, and it will facilitate the interchange of data between different services and applications. The ontology was created based on the results of our three previous studies, which helped us to determinate the terms and relations in the syllabus ontology. The documentation and the computable model are available on the Internet for their reuse.
12714;The Cyber Education Project and IT IAS Curriculum;"The Cyber Education Project (CEP) is an initiative to develop undergraduate curriculum guidelines and a case for accreditation for a baccalaureate in ""Cyber Sciences"" (The Cyber Education Project, 2015). The Learning Outcomes Working Group (LOWG) is in the process of creating a ""taxonomy"" and a set of ""learning outcomes"" for this baccalaureate program.In this document we examine concepts from the disciplines of linguistics, terminology management, knowledge management and ontology development that help illuminate the challenges involved with creating and managing the vocabulary we use to communicate about technical topics. We discuss how the concepts of ambiguity and terminology apply to the CEP and the issues of creating and managing a controlled vocabulary to support a field of study.We discuss the magnitude of the LOWG work by providing general characteristics of 31 glossaries and 5 different taxonomies or Bodies of Knowledge proposed by ""Cyber Security"" related organizations. These include the IAS knowledge areas from IT2008 and CS2013 which have begun to diverge.Finally we conclude with some suggestions of how to approach the creating and managing a vocabulary for Cyber Sciences without losing the connections to the source disciplines and how those source disciplines. IT curriculum must maintain consistency with the evolution of the Cyber Sciences or risk becoming an isolated silo whose IAS curriculum is isolated from an evolving Cyber Sciences community."
12735;SemCCM: Course and Competence Management in Learning Management Systems Using Semantic Web Technologies;The knowledge embedded into the Learning Management Systems (LMSs) contains great potential, but currently is not utilized well enough because the learning content is mainly tailored for human understanding and not for computer processing. The courses in the LMSs cover certain set of topics that are usually exposed through a few general keywords and areas. In this paper the SemCCM system that utilizes the state of the art Semantic Web tools, methods and datasets for automatic semantic annotation of LMS courses is presented. The SemCCM system complements the LMSs through extraction and ranking of the relevant DBpedia resources for each of the courses, and uses their Wikipedia categories for more general area determination. The extracted DBpedia resources, together with their categories represent the specific topics covered by the courses and provide more accurate course retrieval. Together with the users' completed courses, the extracted DBpedia resources are used for determination of the users' competencies. The SemCCM system presents the analysis results to the end users in several different perspectives, enabling semantically enhanced course and user search, graph based course and competence overview, as well as user comparison.
12769;Game Development for Computer Science Education;Games can be a valuable tool for enriching computer science education, since they can facilitate a number of conditions that promote learning: student motivation, active learning, adaptivity, collaboration, and simulation. Additionally, they provide the instructor the ability to collect learning metrics with relative ease. As part of 21st Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE 2016), the Game Development for Computer Science Education working group convened to examine the current role games play in computer science (CS) education, including where and how they fit into CS education. Based on reviews of literature, academic research, professional practice, and a comprehensive list of games for computing education, we present this working group report. This report provides a summary of existing digital games designed to enrich computing education, an index of where these games may fit into a teaching paradigm using the ACM/IEEE Computer Science Curricula 2013 [13], and a guide to developing digital games designed to teach knowledge, skills, and attitudes related to computer science.
12771;An Analysis of the Formal Properties of Bloom's Taxonomy and Its Implications for Computing Education;Educational taxonomies provide conceptual frameworks to deal with different educational issues. In particular, Bloom's taxonomy is popular in CSE, especially in programming courses for assessment purposes. However, different authors have reported difficulties of use, and have even suggested as hypothetical cause an inherent deficiency of the taxonomy. In this paper, we present an analysis of the formal properties of the two versions of Bloom's taxonomy. According to their authorsâ€™ intents, the original taxonomy should be considered a comparative system, while the revised taxonomy would be a classification system derived from the product of two simpler classifications. However, our analysis shows that, among other deficiencies, the taxonomies are ill-defined as classification systems. Two major implications of the analysis are: (a) that instructorsâ€™ difficulties are primarily due to the taxonomies themselves, not to instructors, and (b) an identification of those features of the taxonomies that are deficient, and that therefore allow explaining the difficulties reported. Finally, we discuss some implications of these findings, both in general and for CSE, as well as possible future actions.
12787;Ontological Model for Student's Knowledge Assessment;"This article considers the ontological model for knowledge representation on the example of the discipline ""Database Theory"".Depending on the chosen intelligent system development environment, knowledge must be represented by certain data structures. In this paper, the ontological model is chosen as a model for knowledge representation."
12834;Towards Skills-Based Curriculum Analytics: Can We Automate the Recognition of Prior Learning?;In an era that will increasingly depend upon lifelong learning, the LA community will need to facilitate the movement and sharing of data and information across institutional and geographic boundaries. This will help us to recognise prior learning (RPL) and to personalise the learner experience. Here, we explore the utility of skills-based curriculum analytics and how it might facilitate the process of awarding RPL between two institutions. We explore the potential utility of combining natural language processing and skills taxonomies to map between subject descriptions for these two different institutions, presenting two algorithms we have developed to facilitate RPL and evaluating their performance. We draw attention to some of the issues that arise, listing areas that we consider ripe for future work in a surprisingly underexplored area.
23953;Competency Based Approach: Modeling and Implementation;The expansion of computer networks has at the same time given impetus to the distance learning environments. E-learning systems are also advanced and more efficient. However, these platforms offer such complex teaching functionalities that designers find themselves poorly equipped to succeed in their engineering processes. This article presents a tool that makes it easier for designers to produce educational content according to the Competency-Based Approach (CBA). We propose an implementation of the CBA after its modeling via ontology. Our module can be grafted to any author system oriented pedagogy based skills. We have advocated for Service for Oriented Architecture as a software solution to model our business process that consists of a set of interconnected services that are modeled and implemented. The proposed system is the result of a coordina-tion of, services, incorporating the order of competences explained by a distance education, which integrates and interacts according to an orchestration plan.
23960;A Framework to Assist in Didactic Planning at Undergraduate Level;In the teaching-learning process under the competency-based educational model, the instructor is a facilitator and seeks to generate a flexible and adaptable environment for student learning. One of the first tasks of the facilitator is the structuring of didactic planning. Didactic planning includes strategies for teaching and learning, evidence gathering, and choice of evaluation instruments. In this paper, we propose a framework based on natural language processing techniques with the support of an ontology grounded in the experience of instructors and university level course plans in the information systems area. We employ Bloomâ€™s taxonomy in the ontology design, producing an ascending structure for didactic planning, which allows the student to learn gradually. The developed framework can analyze the key elements that a didactic plan must contain and identify inter-related areas. Evaluation results with Cohenâ€™s kappa coefficient between expert judgement and our framework show that is possible to assist instructors in structuring their didactic planning. Out of the nine processes analyzed with the framework, an almost perfect kappa level was achieved in five processes, a substantial level in three processes, and a moderate level for one process.
23964;A semantic approach to expert system for e-Assessment of credentials and competencies;The Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) is a labor-intensive process for academic advisors, evaluation services, graduate schools, registrars, learners, and other individuals and organizations responsible for assessment of learnerâ€™s credentials and competencies with the purpose of continuing (lifelong) learning. The present paper describes an approach to build an expert system for electronic assessment (e-Assessment) of academic credentials and competencies, which is an e-Learning application intended to essentially help assessors to conduct their work more effective and efficient. The proposed approach uses the semantic web technologies, such as RDFS ontologies and POSL rules to convert academic credentials between educational institutions and make correspondences between the learnerâ€™s competencies and credentials.
23967;The foundation for future education, teaching, training, learning, and performing infrastructure - The open interoperability conceptual framework approach;The proliferation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Education, Teaching, Training, Learning, and the operational application (Performing) of acquired knowledge, skills, and competencies in contemporary social environments has directly influenced the transformation of early Networked Learning (NL) concepts into a Global Learning Infrastructure. Creating cooperative/collaborative stakeholders networks composed of learning subjects, objects, and competencies consumers, exposes the significant potential for gaining overall social progress. The main challenging obstacles of such globalization are: embedding semantics into the competence credentials carriers, trusted dissemination of verifiable competence tokens, the heterogeneous ontologies mapping, and sustainable service delivery infrastructure.The mainstream motivation of our research is the specification and development of a conceptual framework that fosters the interoperability of different stakeholders, whether individual or institutional, to declare, share and maintain the representative collections of information resources related to the particular Education, Learning, Teaching, Training, and Performing (Research, Development, Production, and Service) endeavors.In this article, we have specified an open, heterogeneous, interoperable conceptual framework capable of orchestrating past, current, and future paradigms to foster building the foundations for comparative analysis and evaluation of traditional and nontraditional competency-building processes, joined with students' portfolio creation, dissemination, and management. It is a starting specification that would serve for the future: open, heterogeneous, cooperative/collaborative, service-oriented software framework specification and development.
23988;The development of ontological model for increasing the competitiveness of university graduates in information technologies;The relevance of this work is supported by the need to ensure the professional training compliance with both formal and informal requirements of the education system and the labour market. A lack of methods and technologies being able to harmonize the outcome of the information technologies curriculum and the labour market demands is the reason why the university graduates find it difficult to compete on the labour market. The paper describes the method for an ontological model development that would be able to form the content of the IT-competencies and to assess them in the university students. It is based on two thesis: the first, the boundaries of the subject area of competencies should be defined and, the second, a method of taking into account individual characteristics and needs for creation of an individual professional training and self-study plan should be preliminary considered and developed. The article presents the ontological model developed by the stated method to form the content of the IT-competencies and to assess them for the case of the subject area of 1C: Enterprise platform business solutions. The knowledge base created by the ontological model can be integrated into the decision-making intelligence information systems intended for the sphere of education, corporate training and HR management. This article is aimed at the professionals developing new tools and methods for management of distance education and distance learning.
23992;Computational Assistant for the Assessment University Competencies in B-Learning Environments;Competency assessment is a complex problem that has been approached from multiple perspectives but remains a work in progress. This paper presents a new competency assessment model accompanied by a computational assistant that guides its implementation. The model covers seven phases of an evaluation process, beginning with the definition of the competency and ending with the feedback of evidence provided from the teacher to the students. In each phase, the assistant provides suggestions to the teacher, which are obtained through text analysis algorithms and improve as information is added. The model was validated through pre and post-test study requiring the participation of a group of university teachers. The results indicate that with the use of the model, the time invested by the teacher in evaluation tasks is reduced, the clarity and completeness of the process improves, and an integrated evaluation of generic and specific competences is achieved.
24003;Competence management in knowledge intensive organizations using consensual knowledge and ontologies;This article describes an architecture suitable for use in a competence management system for knowledge intensive organizations (KIOs). The underlying motivation for this work is to explore the practical problems of the use of codified knowledge in knowledge management systems (KMS) in KIOs. We explore some of the key issues associated with the use of tacit and codified knowledge in KMS, and describe an architecture based on an ontology-driven framework derived from collective and consensual knowledge that acts as a structure for a formal knowledge base. We describe, in outline, a prototype competence management system based on this architecture designed to support the management of competencies in a structured way. We conclude with some observations about our approach to the representation of knowledge in a KMS and its potential value to KIOs.
24007;Development of Ontology Based Competence Management Model for Non-Formal Education Services;Competence management is a discipline that recently has regained popularity due to the growing demand for constantly higher competences of employees as well as graduates. One of the main implementation challenges of competence management is that, as a rule, it is based on expertsâ€™ implicit knowledge. This is the reason why the transformation of implicit knowledge into explicit knowledge practically is unmanageable and, as a consequence, limits the ability to transfer the already existing knowledge from one organisation to another.The paper proposes an ontology-based competence model that allows the reuse of existing competence frameworks in the field of non-formal education where different competence frameworks need to be used together for the purpose of identification, assessment and development of customersâ€™ competences without forcing the organisations to change their routine competence management processes. The proposed competence model is used as a basis for development of competence management model on which IT tools that support a competence management processes may be built up. Several existing frameworks have been analysed and the terminology used in them has been combined in a single model. The usage of the proposed model is discussed and the possible IT tools to support the competence management process are identified in the paper.
24068;Evaluation of Digital Competence Profiles Using Dialetheic Logic;Professional profiles are unstructured documents where the knowledge and experience of the editor predominate, presenting inconsistencies and ambiguities in terms of the competencies they contain, making complicated the recognition of knowledge and skills necessary for the proposal of university study programs. Also, the identification of knowledge and skills in digital academic profiles present difficulties due to their inconsistencies. This work proposes analyzing the contradictions or ambivalences found in the academic and professional competencies published in digital media (for example, web pages or social networks) through a model of axioms based on dialetheic logic. Notably, the model considers five types of natural language phenomena: Vagueness or ambiguity, presupposition failure, counterfactual reasoning, fictional discourse, and contingent statements about the future. In addition, the model uses lexical and semantic similarity measures in its analysis process. The dialetheic model is validated using several performance measures to determine its capability to find ambiguity in a competence ontology described using description logic. The results show that dialetheic logic is required to accurately interpret digital academic and professional profiles using computational reasoning mechanisms. The model applies in a Spanish context for computer science jobs, with the possibility to apply in other languages or domains, such as English, French, etc. Our model is a contribution for competencies management, which is useful for the automatic curriculum design, competencies validation in learning processes, among other uses.
24074;A proposal for an adaptive Recommender System based on competences and ontologies;"Context:
Competences represent an interesting pedagogical support in many processes like diagnosis or recommendation. From these, it is possible to infer information about the progress of the student to provide help targeted both, trainers who must make adaptive tutoring decisions for each learner, and students to detect and correct their learning weaknesses. For the correct development of any of these tasks, it is important to have a suitable student model that allows the representation of the most significant information possible about the student. Additionally, it would be very advantageous for this modeling to incorporate mechanisms from which it would be possible to infer more information about the student’s state of knowledge.

Objective:
To facilitate this goal, in this paper a new approach to develop an adaptive competence-based recommender system is proposed.

Method:
We present a methodological development guide as well as a set of ontological and non-ontological resources to develop and adapt the prototype of the proposed recommender system.

Results:
A modular flexible ontology network previously built for this purpose has been extended, which is responsible for recording the instructional design and student information. Furthermore, we describe a case study based on a first aid learning experience to assess the prototype with the proposed methodology.

Conclusions:
We highlight the relevance of flexibility and adaptability in learning modeling and recommendation processes. In order to promote improvement in the personalized learning of students, we present a Recommender System prototype taking advantages of ontologies, with a methodological guide, a broad taxonomy of recommendation criteria and the nature of competences. Future lines of research lines, including a more comprehensive evaluation of the system, will allow us to demonstrate in depth its adaptability according to the characteristics of the student, flexibility and extensibility for its integration in various environments and domains."
24084;The opportunities of cloud computing for managing competences and learning paths in pharmacy;The role of competence management in pharmacy is increasing all the time as healthcare is a field where the fast development of drug treatment and the introduction of new drugs require specialized skills and knowledge that need to be renewed frequently. However, there are two obstacles for the widespread adoption of computer aided competence management in pharmacies. First, pharmacies, as well as most SMEs, do not have enough resources for maintaining competence management systems.

Further, in order to carry out the co-operation of relevant parties, we have developed a competence ontology that specifies shared terminology, and which makes up a shared data store for the co-operating parties.
24094;A semantic web architecture for integrating competence management and learning paths;Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a prototype ontology-based application that has been developed for competency management and learning paths.Design methodology approach - The paper provides an overview of competency management and related work in this area, a description of the competency ontology, and a functional and architectural analysis.Findings - The paper provides information on work related to ontology-based competency management systems, indicating an enhanced approach with a detailed analysis of system architecture and functional analysis.Research limitations implications - The proposed application will be implemented through a .NET deployment, in Microsoft Hellas, the Greek subsidiary of the multinational IT company.Originality value - Ontologies have already been created in different scientific areas, including knowledge and competency management. However, only a few ontology-based applications are available today within the domain of competency management. In this paper an ontology-based application is presented has been developed for competency management and learning paths. Specifically, the paper provides an overview of competency management and related work in this area, a description of the competency ontology, and a functional and architectural analysis.
24106;ASSESSMENT OF STUDENTSâ€™ PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE: INTERDISCIPLINARY ASPECTS (IN THE CASE OF BACHELOR PROGRAM Â«BUSINESS-INFORMATICSÂ»);This article is about the assessment of professional competence of students in terms of the competence-based approach. The stages of the formation of professional competence were formulated, the ontological model of interdisciplinary communication was built, an example of assessing the level of competence was described.
24148;Learning Content Recommendation Service Based-on Simple Sequencing Specification;A new era of e-learning is on the horizon, hundreds of Learning Contents are created and more and more people begin to acquire acknowledge thru e-learning. The traditional teaching method is already showing its limitations that students from different backgrounds are still given the same contents at the same time, and they may only interest in part of a whole learning content. In this paper, we propose a novel way to organize learning contents into small â€?atomicâ€? units called Learning Objects so that they could be used and reused effectively. The Learning Objects together with their ontology are systemized into knowledge base. An intelligent recommendation mechanism based on sequencing rules is then introduced with detail, where the rules are formed from the knowledge base and competency gap analysis. Finally we establish a test knowledge base system, using and extending the ontology editor ProtÃ©gÃ©-2000 and its ProtÃ©gÃ© Axiom Language.
24152;Integrated mathematical model of competence-based learning-teaching process;The competence-based learning-teaching process is a significant approach to the didactical process organization. In this paper the mathematical model of the competence-based learning-teaching process is proposed. The model integrates three models: a knowledge representation model (based on the ontological approach), a motivation model (as a behavioral-incentive model) and a servicing model (in a form of the queuing model). The proposed integrated model allows to control the learning-teaching process on different levels of management. The learning-teaching process can be interpreted as competence-based due to Open and Distance Learning (ODL) philosophy. We assume that the competence is a result of fundamental, procedural and project knowledge acquisition in accordance to the incoming European Qualification Framework.
24164;A formal approach to organization of educational objectives;The organization of educational objectives plays an important role in curriculum development process, since it enables the sequencing of educational experiences. The main goal of this paper is to propose a framework for the formal representation of educational objectives, which enables the evaluation of organization of educational objectives. The model is based on domain ontology, Bloomâ€™s taxonomy and objectives organization in the competence-based knowledge space. The model is verified on the case study that evaluates the studentsâ€˜ achievements in Chemistry field Solutions by conducting an informal knowledge test on the group of 199 14-year-old students of primary schools in the Republic of Serbia. The results obtained from the case study clearly indicate the necessity for including assessment of studentsâ€˜ achievements in the organization of educational objectives. The proposed model enables evaluation of organization of educational objectives which could be further used for an iterative refinement of the organization of educational objectives.
24181;Determination of Professional Competencies Using an Alignment Algorithm of Academic Profiles and Job Advertisements, Based on Competence Thesauri and Similarity Measures;Describing the competencies required by a profession is essential for aligning online profiles of job seekers and job advertisements. Comparing the competencies described within each context has typically not be done, which has generated a complete disconnect in language between them. This work presents an approach for the alignment of online profiles and job advertisements, according to knowledge and skills, using measures of lexical, syntactic and taxonomic similarity. In addition, we use a ranking that allows the alignment of the profiles to the topics of a thesaurus that define competencies. The results are promising, because the combination of the measures of similarity with the alignment with thesauri of competencies offers robustness to the process of generation of professional competence descriptions. This combination allows dealing with the common problems of synonymy, homonymy, hypernymy/hyponymy and meronymy of the terms in Spanish. This research uses natural language processing to offer a novel approach for assessing the match of the competencies described by the applicants and by the employers, even if they use different terminology. The resulting approach, while developed in Spanish for computer science jobs, can be extended to other languages and domains, such is the case of recruitment, where it will contribute to the creation of better tools that give feedback to job seekers about how to best align their competencies with job opportunities.
24203;SvÃ¥righeter i att definiera begreppet kompetens;This article discusses theoretically and philosophically difficulties in defining the notion of competence. â€˜Competenceâ€™ is a key-concept in todayâ€™s educational discussion, where it combines both a psychological meaning of an inner disposition, and a sociological meaning as a category that organises tasks and power-relations in public and private institutions. A short historical overview shows that â€˜competenceâ€™ has a complex etymology that explains these different layers of possible usages and the different ontological and epistemological assumptions that arise from them. Still, the article argues that an ambiguous notion is not a notion with an indistinct meaning. In concrete situations, â€˜competenceâ€™ just has different meanings. Inspired by Wittgenstein, the article takes a philosophical view on science and methodology and argues that the strive to define â€˜competenceâ€™ unequivocally can be understood in different ways. Notions have to be defined unambiguously to make empirical measurements possible. But definitions are running the risk to ignore important meaningful usages for the sake of what is empirically possible to measure and what kind of political interests there are in measuring certain aspects of a complex notions. Finally, it is argued that an ambiguous notion implies risks of undermining critical voices in the discussion about global educational policy.
24206;USING OF METHODS OF ONTOLOGICAL MODELING FOR FORMING OF EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS;The paper presents the possibility of ontological modeling techniques to create educational standards. It is shown t hat the ontological modeling to optimize the description of all levels of the NQF, sufficient to determine the completeness of the infor mation content of subject courses, establish consistency between systems subject knowledge and competencies that need to equip graduates. Ontological models allow also include course content new technological solutions.
24234;An Ontology to Model e-portfolio and Social Relationship in Web 2.0 Informal Learning Environments;Web 2.0 applications and the increasingly use of social networks have been creating new informal learning opportunities. Students interact and collaborate using new learning environments which are structurally different from traditional e-learning environments. In these informal unstructured learning contexts the boundaries between the learning contexts and social spheres disappear, and the definition of the students competences appears more and more important. In this paper we propose a semantic web approach in order to create the basis for a software platform to model learner profiles.In particular we propose to extend the FOAF ontology, used to describe people and their personal relationships, with an ontology related to the IMS Learning Portfolio used to model students' competencies. This ontology could be a fundamental layer for a new Web 2.0 learning environment in which students' informal learning activities carried out in social networks can be managed and evaluated.
24243;Towards an adaptive learning system: An improved competency meta-model;In today's adaptive learning systems (ALS), the main challenge is not limited to publish and reuse online content, but it's to apply pedagogical approaches using information and communication technologies. In this connection, researchers and organizations have shown a growing interest in the competency-based approach that offers the opportunity for learners to adapt and personalize their learning activities and develop their capacities. In this paper, we present our proposal competency meta-model based on the HR-XML specification (Human Resources XML) and the IMS Reusable Definition of Competency or Educational Objective (IMS RDCEO), In order to operationalize it in an ALS.
24295;An Ontology-centered Approach for Designing an Interactive Competence Management System for IT Companies;"The paper presents a generic framework for an intelligent information system of competence management based on ontologies for information technology companies. In a first step it will be applied in an information technology (IT) small enterprise and then its applicability will be verified for other organizations of the same type. The work presented in the paper is performed under the project ""CONTO -- Ontology-based Competencies Management in Information Technology"" funded by the Romanian Ministry of Education and Research, involving two universities, a research institute and an IT private company. The Protege environment was used for the development of this ontology. The structure of the ontology is conceived so that description logics can be used to represent the concept definitions of the application domain in a structured and formally well-understood way. Knowledge acquisition is performed in the approach by enriching the ontology, according to the requirements of the IT company. The paper also presents some use-cases."
24309;A Competence Knowledge Base System as Part of the Organizational Memory;Personal competences of experienced employees are the most important knowledge assets of knowledge-work oriented enterprises. Thus, it makes perfect sense to start IT support for enterprise knowledge management with a system that facilitates finding of appropriate contact persons for business tasks which require specific knowledge, experiences, or skills. We propose such a competence knowledge base system (CKBS) which builds upon an ontology-based model of competence fields, the use of which allows (i) comprehensive multi-criteria organization and queries for personal competences, (ii) complex heuristic inferences for finding knowledgeable persons in spite of vaguely specified information needs, and (iii) easy integration of the CKBS into an overall organizational memory information system.
24336;Where's the Competence in Competence-based Education and Training?;This paper notes the apparent ineffectiveness of the critical response to competenceâ€?based education and training (CBET) and suggests that this results from a failure to correctly isolate CBET's unique, identifying features. It is argued that the prevailing tendency to identify CBET with â€˜competenceâ€™ is fundamentally mistaken and that the competence approach is more properly characterised in terms of its philosophically naÃ¯ve methodological strategy. It is suggested that this strategy is based upon untenable assumptions relating to the semantic status of statements of outcome and the epistemological and ontological constructs to which such statements are intended to correspond.

24480;What does it mean to be a responsible AI practitioner: An ontology of roles and skills;With the growing need to regulate AI systems across a wide variety ofapplication domains, a new set of occupations has emerged in the industry. Theso-called responsible AI practitioners or AI ethicists are generally taskedwith interpreting and operationalizing best practices for ethical and safedesign of AI systems. Due to the nascent nature of these roles, however, it isunclear to future employers and aspiring AI ethicists what specific functionthese roles serve and what skills are necessary to serve the functions. Withoutclarity on these, we cannot train future AI ethicists with meaningful learningobjectives.In this work, we examine what responsible AI practitioners do in the industryand what skills they employ on the job. We propose an ontology of existingroles alongside skills and competencies that serve each role. We created thisontology by examining the job postings for such roles over a two-year period(2020-2022) and conducting expert interviews with fourteen individuals whocurrently hold such a role in the industry. Our ontology contributes tobusiness leaders looking to build responsible AI teams and provides educatorswith a set of competencies that an AI ethics curriculum can prioritize.
24610;School knowledge, science, institution and democracy;The dialectical skirmishes provoked by the new discourse of â€œcompetenciesâ€? have not contributed to rescue the debate on school knowledge from their current lethargy. Among other reasons, due to their insufficient perspective, their obvious omissions, and to reduce the terms of this debate to a superficial and forgetful dualism. Therefore, it is urgent to follow rethinking and problematizing the curriculum. To that end, this paper advocates to expand our perspective with other levels of analysis that allow us to bring to light and defamiliarize the tacit assumptions about the nature and dynamics of the curriculum that tend to be taken for granted. In this sense, it will argue in favor of the imperative need for another kind of â€œontologicalâ€? approach, different from the conventional but also cautious with some postconventional drifts.
69640;E-Learning Based on Metadata, Ontologies and Competence-Based Knowledge Space Theory;The 21st century is challenging the future educational systems with â€˜twitch-speedâ€™ societal and technological changes. The pace of (technological) innovations forces future education to fulfill the need of empowering people of all societal, cultural, and age groups the acquire competences and skills in real-time for demands and tasks we cannot even imagine at the moment. To realize that, we do need smart novel educational technologies that can support the learners on an individual basis and accompany them during a lifelong personal learning and development history. This paper gives some brief insights in approaches to adaptive education based on sound psycho-pedagogical foundations and current technologies.
69644;A Competency-Based Learning Resource Retrieval Process: The LUISA-UHP Case-Study;The paper describes a global framework enabling competency-based search of learning resources making a heavy use of semantic technologies. First it presents the generic components. Then it exemplifies how this framework can be adapted to a given environment, i.e. which knowledge representations, Web Services descriptions and other components have to be tailored or added to the framework. Then it shows step by step how a query is processed, Finally, usersâ€™ feedback, lessons learnt and future trends are provided as well as comparisons with other approaches already published about annotating and retrieving learning objects in Learning Objects Repositories.
69662;The use of an enterprise ontology to support knowledge management in software development environments;Software engineering is knowledge-intensive activity and knowledge is thought to be the most important asset in an organization. Therefore this paper presents an approach to support Knowledge Management in Software Development Environments that is strongly based on ontologies: Enterprise Oriented Software Development Environments. After describing the components of such environments, this paper focuses on the Enterprise Ontology and on three tools developed based on this ontology: a â€˜yellow pagesâ€™ tool which shows the distribution of competencies in the organization, a tool to support the allocation of people to software projects and a graphic tool for representing and visualizing organizational processes.
69824;Towards a competency model: A review of the literature and the competency standards;Competency-based approaches using information and communication technologies have been the main solution of the organizationâ€™s expectations in all fields (public and private) to increase the productsâ€™ quality and employeesâ€™ capacity. Furthermore, the concept of competency can have several different definitions, which may make it difficult to model. As a result, without a good representation of the knowledge and competency and reusable definitions of competence, an e- Learning system will be unable to adapt to its users, to personalize learning activities. In this paper, we present a view of some important competency definitions and the main competency specifications, like the HR-XML specification (Human Resources XML), and the IMS Reusable Definition of Competency or Educational Objective (IMS RDCEO). Moreover, we suggest a competency model for training and education based on these specifications.
69828;Professional Competence of Vocational Teachers: a Conceptual Review;In this article, the variety of interpretations ofÂ the concept of professional competence with reference to vocational teachers is reviewed and discussed. Previous vocational teacher research has been found to focus on which professional competencies vocational teacher possess or should demonstrate, with little focus placed on how competence is defined, leaving a gap related to how the professional competence concept is perceived and constructed. Through a conceptual analysis method (CAM), which follows the data collection process of a systematic literature review, the researcher identifies the concept attributes that are commonly shared as well as neighboring concepts associated with professional competence. Findings indicate that only few studies detail solid concept definitions. Furthermore, there is an agreement amongst the researchers on the main attributes of professional competence, including the situated and developmental character of professional competence as well as its relationship with action. In regard to concept use, there are distinct interrelationships between professional competence, professionalism, performance and qualification. Most definitions regard the individual as the reference point and little to no discussion takes place regarding professional competence at a collective level. Because complex concepts like the one under study can lead to confusion, it is suggested that their use should be accompanied by a discussion of their various meanings.
69847;Broadening design-led education horizons: conceptual insights and future research directions;Design as an overarching pedagogical framework has been regarded by some as the avenue to re-envision general education to develop capabilities required for twenty-first century citizens. However, despite the adoption of design thinking within other domains, generic design-based education for lifelong learning remains largely unexplored. A comprehensive review of literature on educating a workforce for the knowledge economy, and the role of design in business and educational innovation, has been conducted to create a new approach to building a culture of practice for design-led education, based on the theory of the Innovation Matrix. This study proposes â€˜design-led educational innovationâ€™ as a new area of research which requires a deeper understanding of the knowledge, skills and mindsets students require to thrive in the twenty-first century and beyond as lifelong learners in informal and formal education contexts. The findings provide an opportunity to explore dynamic theories and methodologies borrowed from within the field of design-led innovation in business that will broaden the horizons of design-led education, challenging existing practices to transform educational institutions as knowledge creation organisations. This is the first paper to introduce the Design-led Education Innovation Matrix, providing a prototype design-led framework to assist educators in developing and assessing twenty-first century knowledge, skills and mindsets. In addition, it identifies related future research areas for academia, thereby extending the reach and scope of this emerging research area.
69858;Systematic Analysis of Future Competences Affected by Industry 4.0;Digital transformations boosted by new technological innovations entail restructured industrial processes and requalified skilled workers. Educational institutions must provide qualifications with learning outcomes fitting to these requirements. Nowadays skill gap analysis between both sides of labor market is a crucial research topic, but researchers mostly draw consequences from expertsâ€™ visions, trends in past data and not from systematic analysis. Educational institutions must gather information about competences required in the future to start transferring them these relevant knowledge in time. This paper presents an information system dedicated to estimate the importance of actual competences in the future based on different business scenarios.
69879;Designer - Supporting Teachers Experience in Learning Management Systems;In the lifelong learning context, the efficiency of learning is measured according to the usersâ€™ achievement of the target competences. However, in a virtual learning environment supporting the competence development process ends up being an elusive and time-consuming task for teachers or instructional designers. In this paper, we introduce Designer, an approach for teachers to help them in designing courses via a semi-automatic design process based on dynamic user modeling and adaptive learning design generation. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrated the effectiveness of Designer in supporting teachers to create adaptive courses.
98773;Using an ontological model for transfer knowledge between universities;The article deals with construction of the ontological model to provide knowledge transfer between universities. It discusses a need to consider requirements of the professional standard for a specialist and labor market demand in process of educational programs design. Ontological and modular-competence approaches were used to simulate the mapping of competences. An ontological model of the professional competence standard was developed. The information model distributed knowledge database in the university consists of the ontology educational programs, the ontology of professional competencies demanded in the regional labor market and the ontology of scientific knowledge in the university. Classes taxonomy of the developed ontological model of professional competences is presented. The method of analyzing hierarchies was used to assess the conformity of learning outcomes with the functional requirements of labor market. Â© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.
98790;Use of Semantic Technologies for Validation of e-Learning Outcomes;The paper offers means, sources and methods for semantic validation of learning outcomes (including non-formal and informal distant learning) based on the ESCO ontological model and matching of its main concepts. Atomic competencies are used for representation of different components of ontological model that formalizes relations between main subjects and objects of learning process. We analyze specifics of the Web-oriented semantic technologies used for support of elearning. Ontological analysis provides representation of distributed background knowledge about users, their professions, competencies, lifelong learning outcomes, etc., and standards of the Semantic Web project provide the technological foundation for creation of intelligent advisory applications. Validation of learning outcomes of informal and non-formal learning needs in semantic matching of user profiles with classifications of professions and qualifications. Advantages of proposed approach are demonstrated on example of applied information system AdvisOnt developed to combine the market of educational services with the labor market that can use validation of the informal and non-formal learning outcomes.

98799;The concept of personalized e-learning with the use of mobile applications based on ontologies;"The last few years can be described as ""explosive"" in the mobile application development market. There is a huge number of services, this trend affects the business community and the use of mobile technologies in all spheres becomes the norm. Under existing conditions of market relations, enterprises inevitably face the main difficulty-their competitiveness, which is strongly related to the qualification and level of personnel training. Heads of companies are fully aware of the fact that it is necessary to invest today in the development of the company and employees to be successful tomorrow. Top management understands the dependence of the quality of work of employees, departments, units, services and the company as a whole on the quality of training and qualification of personnel. For this purpose, corporate training systems are being developed, based on remote computer training technologies and the use of mobile means. The article describes the content of the developed concept of personalized corporate e-learning using mobile applications based on ontologies. It is concluded that it is crucial to create corporate knowledge bases and a corporate competence catalog. The relevance of building corporate learning systems based on the knowledge base, which is represented by ontologies, that allows you to create educational objects of different levels and complexity is explained. The analysis of the identification of individual characteristics and preferences of employees for training and advanced training represents the great interest, as well as experience in managing intellectual assets of leading companies. It is proposed to integrate LMS with the corporate knowledge base in order to increase efficiency and lack of duplication of information, so that training courses can be created from the available articles. This allows to significantly reduce the time for the preparation of e-learning courses, improve the efficiency of corporate training and reduce the costs of retraining and upgrading the skills of staff.

98830;The Model of Curriculum Constructor;The curriculum constructor model based on ontology that allows establishing connection between curriculum objectives, learning outcomes, expertise and disciplines is introduced in this paper. Thus, it makes possible to consider the compliance of the Education Programme with the learning outcomes and expertise, as well as, it helps check the curriculum goal achievements, the learning outcome development and mastering the competences. The constructor lets create different subsets with different properties and set various individual trajectories. Â© 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
98842;Ontology-based e-Portfolio modeling for supporting lifelong competency assessment and development;Over the last century, different learning theories have shaped the world of education and training before shifting to the competency-based approach (CBA). This new paradigm to teaching and learning aims to ensure that every student has to graduate with the competitive competencies of lifelong learners and is ready to enter the workforce and begin functioning in entry-level positions. However, despite the growing interest in competency-based learning and training, this field still faces numerous challenges, essentially the lack of consensus about an interoperable description of competency evidences. Indeed, the move towards CBA has created a need for effective instruments that support and assess competency development. In this context, the electronic portfolio (e-Portfolio) emerged as a suitable tool that helps learners collect and manage multiple kinds of assessment evidences linked to the program's competencies from multiple sources. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach to e-portfolio modeling which relies on Semantic Web technologies to formally and semantically describe portfolio artifacts that evidence the achievement of one or several competencies. The proposed ontology is structured according to official e-Portfolio specifications, namely IMS ePortfolio and JISC Leap2A. In addition, other existing approaches to e-Portfolio modeling reported in the literature have been explored to avoid misinterpretation of these specifications. Furthermore, a comparative study of common e-Portfolio systems has been carried out in order to gain a fairly accurate idea of the generic structure of an e-Portfolio. Â© 2017 The Author(s).
98866;Using ontologies to design competency-based e-learning applications;Lately, the approaches based on the concept of Competency are widely used in the field of Education as well as in the field of Human Resources Development. Competency Modeling is considered to be essential for any kind of Pedagogical Design within the area of e-Learning applications, adding to them several new possibilities. One of the most popular representations of competencies and learning goals (which are considered a kind of competency) is that of ontologies. This kind of representation allows processing by machines and their incorporation in e-learning applications. The present paper contains the presentation of an ontology-based model for the description of the learners' competencies, created through the combination and the extension of three existing ones. The ontology that we describe, was created as part of an experimental e-learning application for the description and management of competencies, learning goals and learning material about a specific field of knowledge.
98875;An innovative ontology-driven system supporting personnel selection: The OntoHR case;This paper describes the initial development of an HRM system that aims to decrease the gap between higher vocational education and the labour market for a specific job in the ICT sector. This paper focuses specifically on the delineation of a process model and the selection of a suitable job role (information system analyst) that is valid across organisational and cultural boundaries. The process model implies various applied uses of this ontology-based system, including mapping qualifications in vocational education to current and valid job roles, testing and evaluating the student applicant on the basis of labour market driven competencies, and providing ad-hoc support to educational institutions by elucidating the weaknesses of particular VET curricula.

98914;Tracing the metacognitive competencies of online learners;The success of a learning environment can be measured in terms of improvement in learner performances as well as positive learner engagement in metacognitive traits. A large body of educational technology literature establishes a positive correlation between the application of learning technologies and learner performances. In addressing the other aspect of success, this chapter presents a study that lends support to positive learner engagement in the context of metacognitive traits induced through ontology-oriented learning technology. That is, learners are found to benefit from targeted metacognitive activities embedded in online learning environments. To reap this benefit, the educational technology system employed a theory-centric mixed-initiative approach that traces the metacognitive competencies of online learners. This chapter postulates that in addition to providing the metacognitive interface tracing the metacognitive competencies of online learners is critical for the success and sustainability of technology-enhanced learning environments.

98955;Transforming a competency model to parameterised questions in assessment;"The problem of comparing and matching different learners' knowledge arises when assessment systems use a one-dimensional numerical value to represent ""knowledge level"". Such assessment systems may measure inconsistently because they estimate this level differently and inadequately. The multi-dimensional competency model called COMpetence-Based learner knowledge for personalized Assessment (COMBA) is being developed to represent a learner's knowledge in a multi-dimensional vector space. The heart of this model is to treat knowledge, not as possession, but as a contextualized space of capability either actual or potential. The paper discusses a system for automatically generating questions from the COMBA competency model as a ""guide-on-the- side"". The system's novel design and implementation involves an ontological database that represents the intended learning outcome to be assessed across a number of dimensions, including level of cognitive ability and subject matter. The system generates all the questions that are possible from a given learning outcome, which may then be used to test for understanding, and so could determine the degree to which learners actually acquire the desired knowledge.

98962;A competency-oriented modeling approach for personalized e-learning systems;In order to optimize the information retrieval and adaptation facilities inside an e-learning system, there is necessary to improve accessibility and to correlate the educational materials, the users and the information. For this purpose, we present a semantic Web-based modeling approach for the materials annotations and user competences profile, based on the same domain ontology set. The ontologies constitute thus the binder between the materials and users, and we illustrate how their reasoning support contributes to the efficiency improvement of the search and adaptive Web services. As illustrative example, we present our developed I*Teach Web repository of educational scenarios. Â© 2008 IEEE.
98970;Modeling project management competences: An ontology-based solution for competency-based learning;Due to growing requirements for skilled workers, the education should value the outcome and address students' real performance in life. A learning process turns out to be good when the degree of transformation made possible through that process is high or the degree of competences increases. Current paper indicates e-learning as a suitable activity for competences development. The authors also argue that a proper competences modeling solution would increase the efficiency of competence-based learning. Consequently, an ontology based solution is presented for project management domain. Â© 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
98991;Ontology-Based Methodology forÂ KnowledgeÂ MapsÂ Design;"Visualization of corporate knowledge in organizations creates the potential for a significant improvement in the quality of decision making and management efficiency. However, at the moment there is little correlation between the needs of enterprises and new technologies in the field of knowledge engineering. Models and methods of knowledge visualization are not yet mature enough to solve practical problems of information and knowledge management. This is especially true for knowledge-intensive enterprises and organizations, universities, and research institutes. The paper presents a new methodology for the knowledge and competences mapping of the faculty members (or any employees). The methodology is supported by the ontology-based approach and significantly expands the traditional knowledge engineering palette of methods. Ontologies as conceptual models of the subject areas are one of the most promising approaches to the development of knowledge bases and knowledge graphs. The importance of ontology engineering is rapidly gaining the new adopters. The proposed methodology consists of 4 main meta-steps to create a knowledge map: Set of ontologies design (ON);Knowledge elicitation for ontology population (E);Visual knowledge mapping (VI);Knowledge map justification and dissemination (D). The proposed ONE-VID approach was implemented at Graduate School of Management in Saint-Petersburg State University for the sample of 63 faculty members. Several types of K-maps were designed and developed â€“ treemaps, radars, knowledge profiles, etc. The paper describes the new methodology and illustrates the first results. The subsequent longitude study plan is considered that will give the possibility to compare the specific knowledge profiles and gaps as time passes.

98997;Ontology-based approach to formalization of competencies;Competency-based learning has been used in training employees to acquire the necessary skills for an organization to be successful in a dynamic and ever-changing environment. One of the core activities in competency-based training is learning material acquisition. Standardization efforts have made the retrieval of educational materials, also called learning objects, easier by describing them in pre-defined metadata schema. However, the existing standardized metadata schema and practices of learning object metadata annotation do not support automatic selection of resources by specific competency requirements in the competency-based learning. We propose an ontology-based competency formalization approach as a way of representing competency-related information together with other metadata in ontology in order to enhance machine automation in resources retrieval. The approach represents competency with properties of definition, knowledge reference, evidence of proficiency, and level of proficiency. The effectiveness of resource selection from each of the properties is evaluated. Â© 2007 by Idea Group Inc.
99012;Metadata for describing educational competencies: The UOC case;In this paper we describe a proposal for standardizing the concept of competency in a repository of learning objects, by means of an extension of the LOM and the IMS-LD standards, and the use of ontologies for ensuring consistency is also outlined. Following the recommendations from the Bologna Process, we identify the competencies required and developed by means of the current learning resources and formative and evaluation activities in a virtual e-learning environment and, using the most important taxonomies defined for such purposes in the literature, we identify the necessary metadata to describe the competencies related to such learning resources and activities. We discuss the process of shifting from content based metadata to competency based metadata, and we present an example of improving the description of learning resources by adding metadata for describing competencies, using a real case at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.

99054;Digital technologies in the system of professional qualifications: competence based approach;In the article, the issues demanding uniform approach to solution of problems relating to accumulative break between production requirements (business technologies) for personnel occupational competences and those knowledge and skills, which are acquired in the vocational education system (with account of transition to digital economy) are studied. A number of design and procedure developments and analytical approaches in the area of occupational qualification and educational standards system integration with the use of digital technologies based on the principles of mathematical designing, logical modeling and formation of discrete transformation, are presented hereto. Based on discrete approach to formation of knowledge and skills, ontology (tree), by results of research, the mathematical model of the matrix of competences integrated with educational (training) disciplines by means of digital rates implementation, was developed.

99127;Where the competency-based assessment meets the semantic learning analytics;"Studentsâ€™ assessment based on score is no longer relevant today, this is after the major changes of studentsâ€™ way of life and how they receive knowledge, especially after being immersed in social medias and modern technologies. In light of these significant changes, new methods of studentsâ€™ assessment must be adopted in order to respond to the requirements of students of the 21st century, and to provide a real evaluation that reflects their knowledge, performance, and skills. Therefore, the Competency-Based Assessment might be a good candidate to meet these requirements. The scope of this paper is to address the issue of competency modelling in technology-enhanced learning systems in order to discover implicit competencies hidden behind studentsâ€™ activities and how to translate them into acquired competencies. To face these challenges, the authors proposed an approach of semantic analytics of studentsâ€™ activities data. Therefore, they modelled all knowledge about students and their competencies by Semantic Web and ontological representation; then studentsâ€™ models have been subjected to a set of learning analytics approaches in order to analyze and evaluate the generated data according to the assessment model. An experimental study indicates that this approach is efficient and expected to show great advantages in evaluating studentsâ€™ competencies. Â© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."
99131;Working in the 4.0 Era: An Ontology for Competence Management in the Fourth Industrial Revolution;Industry 4.0 is creating a radically more dynamic work environment, which calls for considerable changes in the role of industry professionals. As industries need to respond to evolving trends quickly, as well professionals need to be able to work and constantly learning in this new work environment. Besides, due to the continuous advances in technology and the adoption of these technologies in the industries processes, the level of complexity in the workplace is increasing, which results in the need for a new professional role. However, the main challenge is how to prepare and qualify these professionals to acquire these competences. In order to provide a better understanding of the new professional role and their relationship with the industry 4.0 working environment, this paper introduces an ontology for Competence Management in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Considering the recent scientific and business developments for preparing the industries and workers for this new working era, competences and skills needed for professionals in industry 4.0 were reviewed, as well as challenges and opportunities. Based on a systematic literature review in scientific sources and grey literature, this work identified what technologies are being adopted and what the professional competences are for working in this working environment. Since Industry 4.0 is spreading all over the world, this study contributes to this understanding and also provides a starting point for further research regarding workforce competence management for Industry 4.0.

99219;Ontology development for competence assessment in virtual communities of practice;This paper presents an ontological model for defining competency paths in STEM education, designed for the implementation of an adaptive system integrated in virtual communities. The model is applied for clustering materials for automatic assessment and the results are discussed. Â© Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.
99225;Use of ontologies and the Semantic Web for qualifications framework transparency;The problem of correlating and comparing the levels of the European and national qualifications framework and the potential of the Semantic Web technologies for solving this problem were explored. We substantiated the need for creating models and methods, aimed at providing transparency of the European and national qualifications frameworks and the development of tools for implementing these methods. Authors proposed a reference model of the qualifications framework that formalizes knowledge of basic information objects relating to learning outcomes and their representation in the qualifications frameworks. The specific feature of this model implies using atomic competencies: semantics of information objects of different classes is formalized through the set of such atomic competences that are associated with different properties of these objects. This should provide for the automatic matching of these information objects on the level of knowledge. The methods of quantitative estimation of semantic proximity between information objects of different classes of ontological models, which corresponds to different problems, are proposed in the work. This allows identifying a similarity between learning outcomes, which are described with the use of descriptors of different qualification frameworks. Information regarding atomic competences is obtained from the national and European standards, qualifications frameworks, speciality descriptions, etc. They may be automatically supplemented via analysis of relevant information of Web-resources that contain semantic markup. The work considers in detail the mechanism of integration of the reference information model of competences with technological environment Semantic MediaWiki: ontological concepts and relations are used for semantic markup of Wiki-pages by categories and semantic properties. This allows running a variety of semantic queries to the content of pages, relating to learning outcomes. Examples of such queries are given and their expressive power is analyzed. An example of using the ontological model of competences for improving semantic Web-search for the information for the purpose of supplementing and updating Wiki-pages was studied. The ontology potential in specification of information needs and the increased intersection of the obtained results is demonstrated with the example of the semantic search engine MAIPS. Â© J.

99232;Ontology-based competency management: Infrastructures for the knowledge intensive learning organization;This paper devoted to a new method of competence management that introduced competence as a concept related to a resource-based view on an organization. It emphasizes the importance of this approach for the project-orientated and intensive learning organizations to address the problem of determining the trajectory of employees training and resource planning. Suggests the methods of modeling competencies, resources and knowledge using ontologies to automate the determination of the trajectory of training of staff and resource planning.

99246;A formalism of the competency-based approach in adaptive learning systems;The notion of competence and learner model is the kernel of the Competency-Based Approach (CBA). However, as of today there is not a commonly learner model or ontology for competencies, we have presented in this paper our ontology-based representation in order to define the CBA. This representation provides a baseline for an e-learning adaptive system in which we plan to implement individual learning through individualized learning paths and collaborative learning considering individuals as part of homogeneous groups.
99258;Ontology-based user competencies modeling for e-learning recommender systems;"Inside the e-learning platforms, it is important to manage the user competencies profile and to recommend to each user the most suitable documents and persons, according to his or her acquired knowledge, to their long-term interests, but also according to his very current goals. The authors of this chapter explore a Semantic Web-based modeling approach for the document annotations and user competencies profile development, based on the same domain ontology set. The ontologies constitute the binder between the materials and users. For the user profile development and for the personalized recommendations facilities, the authors' solution propose a hybrid recommender approach: first the user navigation inside the ontology is monitored (instead of user navigation inside the e-learning platform) and the next concept of interest is recommended through a collaborative filtering method; then a content-based recommendation of documents is provided to the user, according the selected concept and his competencies profile. In both phases, a variant of the nearest neighbor algorithm is applied. Â© 2009, IGI Global."
99260;Interoperable assessment based on competency modelling;The aim of this chapter is to illustrate some affordances of machine-processable competency statements. Such competency statements are supported by ontologies and taxonomies of competency. Machine processing can offer interoperable and reusable resources and applications that are pedagogically effective for e-learning and assessment. A competency statement which can be read, processed, and interpreted by machine contributes to the automatic generation of questions and offers a semantic structure using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to express competencies for further processing. The generated questions are expressed in the IMS Question and Test Interoperability specification (IMS QTI) to enable interoperability. Â© 2011, IGI Global.
99265;Competency comparison relations for recommendation in technology enhanced learning scenarios;In this paper, we address the problem of competency comparison, providing some heuristics to help match the competencies of users with those involved in task-based scenario components (actors, tasks, resources). Competencies are defined according to a structured competency model based on a domain ontology. We provide a context for recommendation through a learning scenario model. The approach has been implemented by extending an ontologydriven system called TELOS. It has been tested with a learning unit where these comparison relations are used to provide recommendations to users involved in a technology enhanced learning scenario.
99298;Descriptors for competence: Towards an international standard classification for skills and competences;Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential of already existing skills and competence ontologies to benefit European transparency tools and especially the implementation of the European Qualification Framework. Furthermore, it asks whether any of them could serve as a starting point to develop an International Standard Classification of Skills and Competences to supplement ISCED and ISCO. Design/methodology/approach - This contribution contains a comparative analyses of three systems providing ontologies of skills and competences - DISCO, O*NET and Taxonomy_DB - under terminological and pragmatic aspects. Findings - The analysis identifies O*NET as the most promising candidate to serve European transparency instruments and the EQF. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the development of an International Standard Classification of Skills and Competences, that is suitable for statistical purposes as well as appropriate for practical applications in human resource management and in the area of education, would have to integrate very diverging demands, which so far are being best met by O*NET and DISCO. Research/limitations/implications - The depth of the analysis is not sufficient to serve as an exhaustive guideline to design an International Standard Classification of Skills and Competences. Practical implications - The paper shows the potential of a future International Standard Classification of Skills and Competences for the EQF, for European transparency tools, and for statistical purposes. Originality/value - This article brings a new topic, namely ontologies for skills and competences, into the European debate about competences and their visibility and validation.

99326;Extending Moodle functionalities with ontology-based competency management;The Learning Management System (LMS) Moodle is currently the most popular software solution which provides many modules for various teaching and learning purposes. However, several aspects relevant for competency management are typically missing in Moodle. This paper proposes an ontology-based competency management application which is developed as a Moodle extension for supporting the development and assessment of competencies inside a course. Details about the competency ontology adopted for designing the competency-based course structure as well as the competency management features embedded into Moodle are presented. By incorporating these features into a LMS, it becomes possible to manage target competencies together with their associated evidence items and assess proficiency levels reached by students for each target competency. In addition, it becomes possible to generate different types of competency reports depending on the target role (teachers, students or administrators). Â© 2014 The Authors.

99348;Using data mining techniques to support the creation of competence ontologies;"Skills and competence requirements in the IT and media sector are changing dynamically at a high rate. This makes the ""manual"" adjustment of domain ontologies for this area hardly feasible, so that there is a need for automatic or semi-automatic techniques to update such knowledge bases. Several data mining techniques have been applied to different collections of job offers from this field to test and exemplify the feasibility of this approach. The results are encouraging and will be used to support decisions in professional development. Â© 2009 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved."
99380;A formal model of competence-based assessment;The Bologna Declaration of June 1999 has put in motion a series of reforms needed to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010. One of the most important reforms refers to the pedagogic model defining a competence-based student-centered education model. In this model, the identification of individual ability, talent, and aptitude is deemed to be very important, and the key task of education is self-actualization through recognition and cultivation of such talents and abilities in order to develop competences. Therefore both planning continuing education activities and evaluating these activities after its completion are key processes of such innovative education model. In this paper we present a robust and formal model for developing an evaluation plan of education activities and evaluating these activities after its completion. The aim of the evaluation process is to determine the degree of achievement of competences developed by students during the execution of some continuing education activity. Our approach uses ontologies as formal knowledge representation model to help teachers in developing an evaluation plan of education activities oriented to determine the degree of competence achievement. Once the ontology model of the evaluation plan of an education activity is defined, we propose to use existing reasoning tools to determine the degree of achievement of competences after the activity completion. The resulting evaluation framework is a first approach to a competence-based student-centered evaluation model and can be used as a proof-of-concept system. Â© 2009 The authors and IOS Press.
99391;Interoperable competencies characterizing learning objects in mathematics;Cognitive task analysis has been used in ITSs to predict students' performance, improve curricula and to determine appropriate feedback. Typically, the learning factors/knowledge components have been determined only for the use in one ITS or curriculum and therefore, general frameworks were not applied. Moreover, the result is sometimes rather unsystematic and not reusable across domains. However, for making learning environments interoperable and comparable and to be able to reuse learning objects, the competency hierarchies have to be usable for different learning environments and across domains. In this paper, we propose an approach to competencies represented as pairs of knowledge and cognitive process whose ontologies extend and revise existing taxonomies. A goal is to make these competencies a quasi-standard that enables interoperability and reuse. Moreover, we briefly describe, how the competency ontology can be employed for different purposes.

223571;An ontology based tool for competency management and learning paths;Ontologies have already been created in different scientific areas, including knowledge and competency management, however few ontological applications are available at the moment. In this paper we present an ontology based application that we have developed for competency management and learning paths. Specifically, we provide an overview of competency management and related work in this area, a description of the competency ontology and a functional and architectural analysis. This system is being currently deployed for research purposes in a national subsidiary of Microsoft, the IT services multinational firm, with a Microsoft .NET implementation communicating with the competency ontology.
