ID Paper;Title;Abstract
12443;Competency Models: A Review of Initiatives;"For some years, competency-based learning and training has known a growing interest, especially in conjunction with proliferation of the terms ""knowledge society"", ""citizen mobility"", or ""globalization"". Competency modeling becomes an important concept in many domains, especially in human resource development and e-Learning. In this paper, we present a review of relevant competency metadata standards and some ontology-based approaches for competency modeling."
12501;Comparing the competence contents of demand and supply sides on the labour market;The comparison of competences required by demand side with those provided by supply side of the labour market is profitable for not just job seekers and job posting organizations, but for governmental decision makers, as well. In this paper a system in progress is presented which will be capable of executing this comparison and its three development stages: information extraction from job offers, creation of Job Role and Learning Outcome Ontology, and matching the two ontologies with each other.
12652;Ontology-Based E-Learning Content Recommender System for Addressing the Pure Cold-Start Problem;E-learning recommender systems are gaining significance nowadays due to its ability to enhance the learning experience by providing tailor-made services based on learner preferences. A Personalized Learning Environment (PLE) that automatically adapts to learner characteristics such as learning styles and knowledge level can recommend appropriate learning resources that would favor the learning process and improve learning outcomes. The pure cold-start problem is a relevant issue in PLEs, which arises due to the lack of prior information about the new learner in the PLE to create appropriate recommendations. This article introduces a semantic framework based on ontology to address the pure cold-start problem in content recommenders. The ontology encapsulates the domain knowledge about the learners as well as Learning Objects (LOs). The semantic model that we built has been experimented with different combinations of the key learner parameters such as learning style, knowledge level, and background knowledge. The proposed framework utilizes these parameters to build natural learner groups from the learner ontology using SPARQL queries. The ontology holds 480 learners‚Äô data, 468 annotated learning objects with 5,600 learner ratings. A multivariate k-means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique for grouping similar data, is used to evaluate the learner similarity computation accuracy. The learner satisfaction achieved with the proposed model is measured based on the ratings given by the 40 participants of the experiments. From the evaluation perspective, it is evident that 79% of the learners are satisfied with the recommendations generated by the proposed model in pure cold-start condition.
12662;Open Assessment Resources Recommendation for Competence Assessment;"In recent years, and in the development of online learning, UNESCO developed the ""Open Educational Resources OER"" approach. This approach refers to educational, learning or research resources in the public domain or released with an intellectual property license to use, adaptation and free distribution. These resources are stored in large databases called repositories. Assessment is an essential component of learning. This activity is useful not only formal, but also for the Online Learning and other continuing education activities. Based on the competence profile of a learner, we will propose, in this paper, a recommendation approach of OERs / OARs from a chosen repository to help learners to assess its competences and get those that are required."
12671;Modelling Competencies for Computing Education beyond 2020: A Research Based Approach to Defining Competencies in the Computing Disciplines;How might the content and outcomes of tertiary education programmes be described and analysed in order to understand how they are structured and function? To address this question we develop a framework for modelling graduate competencies linked to tertiary degree programmes in the computing disciplines. While the focus of our work is computing the framework is applicable to education more broadly. The work presented here draws upon the pioneering curricular document for information technology (IT2017), curricular competency frameworks, other related documents such as the software engineering competency model (SWECOM), the Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA), current research in competency models, and elicitation workshop results from recent computing conferences. The aim is to inform the ongoing Computing Curricula (CC2020) project, an endeavour supported by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the IEEE Computer Society. We develop the Competency Learning Framework (CoLeaF), providing an internationally relevant tool for describing competencies. We argue that this competency based approach is well suited for constructing learning environments and assists degree programme architects in dealing with the challenge of developing, describing and including competencies relevant to computer and IT professionals. In this paper we demonstrate how the CoLeaF competency framework can be applied in practice, and though a series of case studies demonstrate its effectiveness and analytical power as a tool for describing and comparing degree programmes in the international higher education landscape.
12679;Towards a Framework for Ontology Learning from Interactions in Natural Language and Reasoning;In this paper, we present an approach based on Reasoning and Natural Language Processing for Ontology Learning, specifically over Description Logic (DL) knowledge bases constituted by a TBox with ALC expressivity, from interactions with users in controlled natural language text. The viability of our approach is demonstrated through the generation of descriptions of complex axioms from concepts defined by users. We evaluated our approach in an experiment with entry interactions enriched with hierarchy axioms, disjunction, conjunction, negation, as well as existential and universal quantification to impose restriction of properties. The obtained results prove that our model is an effective solution for reasoning, knowledge representation and automatic construction of expressive ontologies. Thereby, it assists professionals involved in processes for obtain, construct and model knowledge domain.
12688;Open Educational Practices and Resources Based on Social Software, UTPL Experience;"Open Educational Practices and Resources are a direct response to privatization of knowledge; they promote their exchange across the world with the aim of increasing human intellectual capacity. In this document we will discuss the Open Educational Practices and Resources Movement and the notion that knowledge is a public good where technology in general, and specifically Web 2.0, provide an extraordinary opportunity for people to acquire key competences in a knowledge society while they share, use, and re-use digital contents. We will describe the key function of tools and services based on Social Software in the Web 2.0 environment in the OERs production, based on experiences gained at the Universidad T\'{e}cnica Particular de Loja (Ecuador). Moreover, we describe the commitment of the University to the promotion of open educational practices and resources and their impact on society and knowledge economy. This is accomplished through the use of Social Software as a potential key to producing changes in the actual production model, moving from a hierarchical transfer of knowledge from the teacher to a new range of open and collaborative educational practices centered on the student."
12710;Resources and Semantic-Based Knowledge Models for Personalized and Self-Regulated Learning in the Web: Survey and Trends;Learning is a complex and multifaceted process. Research findings in recent years show that student's control over the learning process is important for achieving higher results. As every student or lifelong learner have his specific interests and needs, in many cases no one learning course can meet all these needs. It is important to ensure possibilities for learners to find additional knowledge sources or tools during his learning process. Cloud Learning consider the entire Web (including Social Web tools, Open Educational Resources and many other sources for learning) as a space for learning content. Finding exactly the needed resource for every learning need in this enormous space is a challenge. There is a need to explore all the resources useful for learning, classify them in a way that will support searching, and to express relations between them using semantic annotations.In this paper we analyze the current state of the resources, appropriate for learning in the internet from technological point of view. We classify resources according to several dimensions, important for searching and using by learners. We take special attention to the ways of semantic description of resources and users (used metadata and models) as metadata are the most important for finding the most appropriate resources for specific learning task. Tasks as searching and retrieval for learning are not new and our main aim in this work is to outline resent changes in web-based learning, resulting from technological changes and discuss how they will affect resource searching. We will discuss how cloud-based technologies and embedded semantic descriptions will simplify searching and finding appropriate learning sources.
12782;Designing Computer Science Competency Statements: A Process and Curriculum Model for the 21st Century;The broadly influential document Computing Curricula 2005 (CC2005) is in the process of being updated through a project called Computing Curricula 2020 (CC2020). CC2020 provides a vision for the future of computing education, including a comprehensive report that contrasts curricular guidelines, and contextualizing those guidelines within the broader landscape of computing education. In the process, a framework of competency-based educational principles has been developed which is closely aligned with other skills and qualifications frameworks. This working group report demonstrates one way in which the transition from current learning-outcomes-based practices to the competency-based practices can be approached. Further, the paper discusses the challenges and insights that have emerged as the learning outcomes for various Knowledge Areas in the CS2013 report were re-expressed in terms of competencies.
23940;Teamwork assessment in the educational web of data: A learning analytics approach towards ISO 10018;For business and educational institutions competences assessment is essential. Assessed competences may be used as learning resources in linked data contexts. Authors have developed a learning analytic tool to assess teamwork competence. The LA tool allow populate evidences to an ontology adapted to ISO 100800. Populated learning evidences can be exploited in educational linked data contexts.The Web of Data is an emerging research field that contributes to make better decisions because it gathers, combines and analyses different data sources available worldwide. Educational data is an interesting domain because it deals with the quality of the education itself and educational institutions which are common goals for every country. This paper is devoted to present how this idea has been used to improve a learning analytics tool. By means of this tool, teachers can perform teamwork competence assessment of a group of students taking into account how the individuals acquire the essential components of such competence. In this sense, authors use the Comprehensive Training Model of the Teamwork Competence in Engineering Domain (CTMTC) method to gather competence evidences and improve the system with a learning analytics tool to support the process. This tool is able to transform competence evidences and stores them in a competence ontology built upon ISO 10018 concepts. The final result is the production of educational results for the web of data.
23941;A new competency ontology for learning environments personalization;Competency is a central concept for human resource management, training and education. We define a competency as the capacity of a person to display a generic skill with a certain level of performance when applied to one or more knowledge entities. Competencies, and competency referentials grouping competencies, are essential elements for user models, e-Portfolios, adaptive learning, and personalization in Technology-based learning. But to be processed both by humans and by software tools, competencies should be represented in a formal, non-ambiguous model called an ontology. Moreover, this model should use a shared vocabulary to describe the generic skills and the knowledge entities. Defining and linking shared vocabularies is the purpose of ontologies in the semantic web. The goal of our research is to develop a competency ontology for the semantic web to be used as a shared referential in the description of competencies and competency profiles. We analysed five previous competency models and developed COMP2, a new competency ontology that integrates important elements of previous models and the richness of the semantic web vocabulary. COMP2 provides processing capabilities both to humans and computers. Its graphic model is highly readable by humans for design, evaluation and communication purposes. It also translates, together with its data sets, to standard semantic Web code for machine processing. The ontology is composed of five stages that are interlinked with other ontologies in use within the web of linked open data. We will present an example for the use of the ontology for competency-based personalization in learning environments.
23946;An Ontology and a Software Framework for Competency Modeling and Management;The importance given to competency management is well justified. Acquiring new competencies is the central goal of any education or knowledge management process. Thus, it must be embedded in any software framework as an instructional engineering tool, to inform the runtime environment of the knowledge that is processed by actors, and their situation toward achieving competency-acquisition objectives. We present here some of our results in the last 10 years that have led to an ontology for designing competency-based learning and knowledge management applications. Based on this ontology, we present a software framework for ontology-driven e-learning systems.
23958;An ontology-based model for competence management;In the last years, the need for developing strategies, models and tools to manage competences clearly emerges in numerous scenarios. For instance, this emergence especially raises when it is required to realize effective recruiting platforms, decision support systems for human resource management, learning management systems and so on. This work proposes an ontology-based model for the representation of competences able to support a wide range of scenarios where it is fundamental to model, organize and represent professional competences, enable interoperability and co-operation among different and heterogeneous tools and, lastly, execute queries and inference operations over these competences. The proposed model starts from the outcomes of the specialized literature and the related R&D projects and produces a novel integrated model that represents both job offers and demands to support recruiting initiatives and to develop employability strategies aiming at a best matching as well as a careful skill gap analysis.The model has been evaluated by means of a three-level approach also in the context of the SIRET project whose goal is defining a recruiting and training integrated system able to represent the professional competences of users and to understand the supplies and the demands in order to find optimal agreements in the job market.
23973;Towards a common and semantic representation of e-portfolios;PurposeSince the early 1980s, a paradigm shift, caused by the work undertaken in the field of cognitive psychology, has occurred. This shift is known as the move from teacher-centered instruction to learner-centered or learning-centered instruction, and emphasizes the importance of building new knowledge on previous ones, interacting with peers, making meaningful and reflective learning and being engaged in his own path to foster learning. This new vision of teaching has created a need for new learning and assessment instruments that are better adapted to these pedagogical realities. In this context, the electronic portfolio or e-portfolio is one of the most versatile and effective tools that have been proposed for this purpose. More specifically, the interest in e-portfolios has grown considerably with the emergence of the competency-based approach and portfolio-based competency assessments. The purpose of this paper is to describe a semantic-based representation of e-portfolios, defined on the basis of official e-portfolio standards and specifications. Moreover, a comparative study of several well-known e-portfolio solutions has been carried out based on different facets, such as functional features, technical and organizational features. The objective is to identify those features that are mostly supported by e-portfolio solution providers and accordingly to gain a fairly accurate idea of the common structure of e-portfolios. In addition, the authors take advantage of an already implemented ontological model describing competency-related characteristics of learners and learning objects and combine it with the e-portfolio ontology, with a view to support a more reliable and authentic competency assessment.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed e-portfolio ontology was built following the ontology development methodology Methontology (Fernandez et al., 1997). In addition, it was constructed using the Prot√©g√© ontology environment (Prot√©g√©, 2007) and was implemented in OWL (Web Ontology Language) (Antoniou and Harmelen, 2004).FindingsThe proposed e-portfolio ontology provides humans with a shared vocabulary that enables capturing the most important elements in e-portfolios and serves as the basis for the semantic interoperability for machines.Originality/valueThe main advantage of the e-portfolio ontology lies in its ability to provide a common and semantically enriched representation of e-portfolio artifacts, thus facilitating the interoperability and exchange of competency evidences between different learning systems and platforms. In addition, capturing the semantics of e-portfolios helps to make them utilizable by intelligent applications.
23986;Interoperability Framework for Competences and Learning Outcomes;This research work was carried out in the areas of Higher Education, Teaching Technology and Web Information Management with the aim of developing a model for identifying and classifying competences and learning outcomes (MICRA) and an ontology of the information management model (SICRA). The MICRA model was applied in a case study, whereas the verification and validation of its previously defined functionalities led to ontology validation. MICRA shows to be an innovative model, based on a thorough, organized and systematic analysis of the educational context. In addition, SICRA goes beyond other ontologies as it not only defines reusable competences, classified according to Bloom's taxonomy, but also defines and establishes a correspondence among Computer Science Knowledge Areas. We have thus contributed to making learning institutions' training curricula widely available, allowing for their contrastive analysis in order to promote student and teacher mobility within the European Higher Education Area and in other countries.
23993;Comparison of knowledge during the assembly process of learning objects;This paper describes the conceptual frameworkOntoGluefor the assembly of learning objects (LOs). To permit a coherent assembling process from the point of view of requirements and competencies, OntoGlue enhances the definition of LOs by includingassociated knowledge(i.e. requirements and competencies) in their conceptual data schema. This associated knowledge is defined in terms of classes of educational ontologies (used as taxonomies), possibly related by mappings. There are several advantages associated with the OntoGlue approach. Firstly, it provides an enhanced description of the LOs, which permits their search and reuse by considering requirements and competencies. Secondly, during the assembly process of two LOs, OntoGlue checks that the competencies of the first LO cover the requirements of the second LO, guaranteeing a coherent assembling process from the requirements and competencies‚Äô point of view. Thirdly, OntoGlue automatically calculates the meta-data of the resulting assembled LO. Finally, the definition of the associated knowledge in terms of classes of ontologies, possibly related by mappings, permits an advanced comparison of requirements and competencies during assembly and search processes.
24002;A general model for competency repositories and its instantiation to the information systems domain;Competency repositories have been developed for several years with various objectives: helping to establish competency assessments, helping with recruitment, helping to build training. A repository can bring together the descriptions of several hundred competencies. However, few studies have focused on the structuring of a competency repository. In this paper, the authors propose a general model for a competency repository based on 5 principles. Two of them consist in using a composition relationship to define competencies at several levels of abstraction and a prerequisite relationship to establish prerequisites between competencies. To illustrate the model, an application in the domain of information systems design and implementation is fully developed. The proposed repository, in addition to a new structure, incorporates new competencies compared to existing IS repositories, in particular with regard to strategic management of the IS, development methodologies and techniques, interpersonal competencies, prerequisites coming from basic disciplines. This repository aims primarily to help the organization of academic and professional training and to allow the assessment of personal competencies. This initiative comes from the French network of MIAGE (M√©thodes Informatiques Appliqu√©es √† la Gestion des Entreprises) masters.
24034;Towards a Semantic Framework for Lifelong Integrated Competency Management and Development;AbstractIn the domain of technology-enhanced competency-based learning and training, there is an increased interest in the integration of competency-related information for supporting competency-driven decision-making purposes. Indeed, since competency development draws upon several related areas, including teaching subjects, instructional design, learning resource annotation, e-Portfolios and motivated by the need for an integrated and semantic-based approach to competency management and development, a series of ontological structures have been formalized and developed for each of these areas. This paper aims to provide a framework specification for lifelong competency management and development, called LCMDF. The main advantage of this framework lies in its ability to provide a unifying semantic foundation in the form of a set of controlled vocabularies for describing competencies and their related details within the contexts of technology-enhanced competency-based learning and training. Moreover, this framework provides a novel integrated model to support a wide range of use cases. The proposed framework results from reusing widespread international standards for competency modeling which helps designing and implementing interoperability architecture of semantically-enhanced competency-based learning/human resource (HR) systems.
24047;Computing with competencies: Modelling organizational capacities;‚ñ∫ We review the current state of competency models and the needs for more complex competency schemas. ‚ñ∫ We present a general model for expressing competencies and how it is expressed in the form of an ontology. ‚ñ∫ We describe how that model can be used for different tasks involving computation and inference with competencies.The notion of competency provides an observable account of concrete human capacities under specific work conditions. The fact that competencies are subject to concrete kinds of measurement entails that they are subject to some extent to comparison and even in some sense, calculus. Then, competency models and databases can be used to compute competency gaps, to aggregate competencies of individuals as part of groups, and to compare capacities. However, as of today there is not a commonly agreed model or ontology for competencies, and scattered reports use different models for computing with competencies. This paper addresses how computing with competencies can be approached from a general perspective, using a flexible and extensible ontological model that can be adapted to the particularities of concrete organizations. Then, the consideration of competencies as an organizational asset is approached from the perspective of particular issues as competency gap analysis, the definition of job positions and how learning technology can be linked with competency models. The framework presented provides a technology-based baseline for organizations dealing with competency models, enabling the management of the knowledge acquisition dynamics of employees as driven by concrete and measurable accounts of organizational needs.
24054;Competence as a Key Concept of Educational Theory: A Semiotic Point of View;In this article, the concept of competence is studied from the point of view of the semiotics of education. It will be claimed that it is a central key concept when we are trying to analyse the meaning of education. Educational action can be reasonably understood as an insecure and complicatedly mediated trial to affect another person's competence. First, the recent discussion about the concept of competence and its relatives is shortly reviewed. Then, competence is analysed and defined according to Greimassian semiotic theory as a basic determining character of an acting subject. At the same time as competence is indispensably central for understanding the subjects of action, it is problematically empirically ineffable. This ineffability has a special meaning in education, where we must try to both plan our own educative action and evaluate the learning of the student according to these invisible features. It is proposed that in the recent discourse of education, the very popular use of the concept of competence is misguided and problematically mixed with its conceptual counterpart performance. From this viewpoint, the concept of competence should rather be connected to the ontological concept of disposition. The problem of multi‚Ä?dimensionality of competence is considered with the help of the Greimassian conception of modalities to create a richer and more detailed picture of the role of competence in action, and especially in education.

24182;TRANSPARENCY OF EUROPEAN AND NATIONAL FRAMEWORK OF QUALIFICATIONS ON THE BASIS OF COMPUTER ONTOLOGY;"The article shows the potential of computing ontologies in ensuring transparency of European and national qualification frameworks. Found that the European Qualifications framework consists of eight interconnected levels that describe the qualification using learning outcomes ‚Äì triad competencies: knowledge, skills and competences. Results orientation training helps you compare qualifications and simplifies the procedure for their acceptance. Examples of tools facilitating the correlation of levels of European and national qualification frameworks; list the advantages and disadvantages of each. It is proved that the transparency of qualification frameworks can be successfully achieved if they are implemented in the form of computer-based ontologies. It is shown that ontology is a description of declarative knowledge in the form of classes and the relationships between them. The Protege-OWL editor for building domain-oriented ontology is described. An example of computer-designed ontologies and their ability to ensure the transparency of the European and national qualification frameworks is proposed"
24250;An Ontology-Based Modeling Approach for Developing a Competencies-Oriented Collective Intelligence;Expressing the user competences through domain ontology concepts is a prerogative for developing well managed and semantically enriched user profiles, transferable from a system to another. If, supplementary, the available documents are also ontology-based annotated, the add-on value will concern not only the document semantics, but also the relations and dependencies between users and documents. In such approach, the ontology constitutes the binder between peoples, as well as between peoples and documents, and also between documents. Its reasoning support sustains the development of a collective intelligence, as well as the most suitable knowledge sharing, according to the users common competencies. In this article we present such modeling approach, and also some methods for user and document model development, as well as the advantages for personalized and collaborative facilities.
24265;El concepto de competencias y su adopci√≥n en el contexto universitario;La formaci√≥n por competencias se ha transformado, en t√©rminos de dise√±o y desarrollo curricular, en el eje del cambio educativo.

24327;Generative instructional engineering of competence development programmes;Competence development programmes are collections of units of learning and learning activities used to increase the overall effective performance of a learner within a certain task. The definition of a competence development programme is fairly complex and subject to variability, depending on the available learning units and components. Some instructional engineering approaches have been successfully used to create courseware by the combination of existing learning resources within a systematic and iterative method. In this work, a generative, model-driven engineering approach is used to create and adapt competence development programmes from families of available learning components, such as units of learning, learning designs, and learning services. The process begins from the statement of the learning goals as feature models, and carries out a number of transformations from the analysis model down to learning designs and implementation components. However, shared definitions for competence-related terms and computational semantics are essential in this effort. In this paper, ontologies are proposed as a means to that end. In particular, the transformations between models are defined with the help of a general competence ontology.
24400;Semantic-based skill management for automated task assignment and courseware composition;Knowledge management is characterized by many different activities ranging from the elicitation of knowledge to its storing, sharing, maintenance, usage and creation. Skill management is one of such activities, with its own peculiarities, as it focuses on full exploitation of knowledge individuals in an organization have, in order to carry out at best given tasks. In this paper a semantic-based automated Skill Management System is proposed, which supports competences search and creation. The system implements an approach exploiting the formalism and the reasoning services provided by Description Logics. The approach embeds also non standard Description Logics reasoning services to extend the set of provided features. Here we present main characteristics of our system and focus on a novel algorithm exploiting advanced inference services for the one-to-one assignment of a set of individuals to a set of tasks, endowed of logical explanation features for missing/conflicting skills.
24509;EDISON Data Science Framework: Part 1. Data Science Competence Framework (CF-DS) Release 4;"The Data Science Competence Framework (CF-DS) is a cornerstone component of the whole EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF). CF-DS provides a basis for the Data Science Body of Knowledge (DS-BoK) and Model Curriculum (MC-DC) definitions, and further for the Data Science Professional Profiles definition and certification. The CF-DS incorporates many of the underpinning principles of the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF3.0) that have been used for the Data Science competences definition; in its own turn, this allowed to provide extensions of the new e-CF4.0 version (published as CEN EN 16234-1, 2019) with the Data Science competences. The CF-DS and DSPP have also adopted the classification structure of the European Skills, Competences, Occupations (ESCO) Framework. Corresponding information is provided in the corresponding documents CF-DS and DSPP. This presented Data Science Competence Framework definition is based on the analysis of existing frameworks for Data Science and ICT competences and skills and is supported by the analysis of the demand side (job market) for Data Science professionals in industry and research. The presented CF-DS Release 4 is extended with the skills and knowledge subjects/units related to all competences groups. The document also refined the Data Science workplace) skills definition that includes the Data Science professional skills (Acting and thinking like Data Scientist) and the definition of the general ‚Äúsoft‚Ä? skills often referred to as 21st Century skills. The current EDSF Part 1 document defines the Data Science Competence Framework and includes the following components: The CF-DS defines five groups of competences for Data Science that include Data Analytics, Data Science Engineering, Domain Knowledge, Data Management and Governance, Research Methods and Project Management for research related occupations, or Business Process Management for business related occupations. The document provides examples of the individual competences mapping to identified skills and knowledge topics for the Data Science Analytics competence group. The identified competences, skills, and knowledge subjects are provided as enumerated lists to allows easy use in applications and provide a basis for developing compatible APIs. The presented CF-DS definition is supported by the corresponding Excel documents and ontology definition that contain a full list of enumerated EDSF attributes. The proposed EDSF, and CF-DS in particular, are intended to provide guidance and a basis for universities and education practitioners to define their Data Science curricula and courses selection, on the one hand, and for companies to better define a set of required competences and skills for their specific industry domain in their search for Data Science talents, on the other hand. The EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) includes the following main components: Data Science Competence Framework (CF-DS), Data Science Body of Knowledge (DS-BoK), Data Science Model Curriculum (MC-DS), Data Science Professional Profiles (DSPP), which are extended with new Part 5. EDSF Use cases and applications (EDSF-UCA). The EDSF provides a conceptual basis for the Data Science Profession definition, targeted education and training, professional certification, organizational capacity building, and organisation and individual skills management and career transferability. The initial definition of the EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) was done in the Horizon2020 Project EDISON (Grant 675419) that produced Release 1 in 2016 and published Release 2 in 2017. Currently, EDSF is maintained by the EDISON Community initiative that is coordinated by the University of Amsterdam. The new EDSF Release 4 is the product of the wide community of academicians, researchers and practitioners that are practically involved in Data Science and Data Analytics education and training, competences and skills management in organisations, and standardisation in the area of competences, skills, occupations and digital technologies. In particular, the current release incorporates revisions to competences proposed during the Data Stewardship Professional Competence Framework (CF-DSP) definition by the FAIRsFAIR project (Grant 831558)."
58072;"The ontology of the competency-based approach and the perspectives of implementation
";"This article is a continuation of our researches on the competency-based approach (CBA). It presents the ways that can facilitate and generalize the understanding of CBA, its adoption and its implementation in the educational system of Morocco. The work described in this paper aims of the final stages of an ontologyís development, when consensus is reached. More precisely, the stage of operationalization: the process that allows the transforming from the conceptual representation of knowledge in an ontology regardless of use, to one operational
representation appropriate to its use. This article gives an overview of the constraints that characterize this stage and opportunities that can be offered by the ontologyís implementation. It outlines a functional draft of a learning platform architecture based on CBA, in order to guide the choices made in the operationalization phase of CBA ontology."
58073;An Ontology-Based Approach to Competency Modeling and Management in Learning Networks;"With the emergence of the paradigm of Lifelong Learning and the proliferation of the terms ""knowledge society"", ""citizen mobility"", or ""globalization"", competency-based learning and training has known a growing interest in technology-enhanced learning as it provides important benefits for both individuals and organizations by supporting the transformation of learning outcomes into permanent and valuable knowledge assets. In this context, to promote the acquisition and continuous development of new competencies, learning networks have emerged that enables to support the provision of various lifelong learning opportunities. However, lifelong competency development still faces numerous challenges and research issues that need to be addressed, primarily the lack of consensus about a common representation of competencies and competency profiles. This paper analyzes different approaches reported in literature for competency modeling and proposes a competency ontology to formally describe competency-related characteristics of actors and learning resources in learning networks. The proposed ontology also aims to model aspects related to competency information management and tracking in order to support lifelong competency development in learning networks."
69643;Design Principles for Competence Management in Curriculum Development;This paper discusses the ontology-based competence management in the context of curriculum development. The data was collected through two participatory design experiments, which were conducted to develop and formatively evaluate the designs and scenarios for computer-supported curriculum development in higher education context. These experiments involved the use of prototypes of software tools developed in two different research projects: Intelleo and ePoAbi. As a result, the paper proposes ontology-based design principles to computer-supported curriculum development, course development and curriculum evaluation.
69650;Competency-based personalization for massive online learning;This paper investigates the problem of personalization in massive open online courses (MOOC) based on a target competency profile and a learning scenario model built for the course. To use such a profile for adaptive learning and resource recommendation, we need to be able to compare competencies to help match the competencies of learners with those involved in other learning scenario components (actors, activities, resources). We present a method for computing relations between competencies based on a structured competency model. We use this method to define recommendation agents added to a MOOC learning scenario. This approach for competency comparison has been implemented within an experimental platform called TELOS. We propose to integrate these functionalities to a MOOC platform such as Open-edX. We present a personalization process and we discuss the tools needed to implement the process.
69659;Competence analytics;A smart learning environment is characterized by the key provision of personalized learning experiences. To approach different degrees of personalization in online learning, this article introduces a framework called Smart Competence Analytics in LEarning (SCALE) that tracks finer-level learning experiences and translates them into opportunities for customized feedback, reflection, and regulation. The SCALE framework is implemented in four layers: the sensing layer, the analysis layer, the competence layer, and the visualization layer. The sensing layer provides the datasets to support context-awareness through state-of-the-art sensing technologies. The analysis layer, by the means of powerful code analysis tools, derives performance metrics (e.g., learner coding metrics) which serve as input to the competence layer to identify proficiency levels of learners. Finally, a learning analytics dashboard called MI-DASH (visualization layer) allows interaction with performance and competence metrics. The current SCALE system has been used in a study to track the habits, performances, and competences of novice programmers. Growth of coding competences of first-year engineering students has been captured in a continuous manner. Students have been provided with customized feedback to optimize their learning paths. The article describes the analytics-based approach pursued in the study and highlights key findings.
69664;Reasoning about Skills and Competencies;Human Resources Management (HRM) is the strategic management of the employees, who individually and collectively contribute to the achievement of the strategic goals of an organization. Most HRM tasks are based on acquiring the right information and reasoning about skills and competencies of individuals. In this paper we present a formal ontology for competency management and consider three reasoning problems related to HRM, namely, determining the set of skills of an individual, conducting competency gap analysis, and determining whether an individual satisfies a set of requirements.
69791;Hermeneutic Dimensions of Competency-Based Education and Training;A distinctive feature of contemporary professional, vocational and continuing education is the prevalence of the ‚Äòcompetency‚Äô approach. So-called competency-based education or training (CBE/T) can be adopted as a basis for programs of learning, frameworks for development within occupations, or for national systems of vocational education. Its application is observed across a wide range of occupations ‚Äì from gardening to teaching to piloting aircraft ‚Äì and to diverse levels of expertise, from entry-level to continuing professional development. Although acceptance of the competency-based approach is widespread, there is still debate about its meaning and merits. Just as diverse applications can be cited, there are varying definitions and rationales for the approach. And while CBE/T appeals to common sense, there have been and continue to be challenges and criticisms from different disciplinary perspectives and with respect to its features and impacts. In this paper a special set of problems with CBE/T is examined. A model is presented which differentiates three interrelated components: competence, competency texts and CBE/T. By separating the definition into three components, a little-understood characteristic of the approach is foregrounded ‚Äì processes of interpretation that translate between these components. The model thus exposes ‚Äòhermeneutic‚Äô dimensions of the competency approach which are argued to be key to understanding a number of problems associated with CBE/T. The paper concludes that the hermeneutic features of the competency approach represent challenges for basic assumptions of the model.
69876;Traditional and new ways in competence management: Application of HR analytics in competence management;This article within the magazine Gruppe. Interaktion. Organisation. (GIO) provides an overview of established and new ways in competence management, with a¬†focus on the HR Analytics approach. Competence management has come a¬†long way. Since the beginning of competence research in the 1970‚Äôs technological progress and altering competence demands among employees have drastically reshaped the landscape of employment. Handling complexity and large amounts of information has become essential in order to keep up with developments of today‚Äôs world. The globalised competition has fostered an increasingly intense ‚ÄòWar for Talents‚Äô  under volatile circumstances. How can an organisation develop an anticipative competence strategy if there are so many variables regarding the future? Since digitalization and the evolving field of big data and predictive analytics enable new ways of information processing, new concepts for human resources management are required. The most prominent approach nowadays is a¬†company-specific competence model that is derived from the organisational strategy. Employees are developed with regard to the competence strategy‚Äîeven though it might turn out as too rigid to react flexibly to changing environmental conditions in a¬†steadily faster global competition. We state that this process can be extended by a¬†data-driven approach in order to support HR departments and achieve an improved rate of correct assessments for future HR developmental measures.
98748;An ontology-based approach to aid the application of competency-oriented curriculum principles in open educational resources;Competency-based education has attracted the attention of the technology-enriched learning community but presents challenges in translating competency-oriented curriculum principles into concrete learning materials. This project aims to provide a framework to support the annotation of open educational resources based on competency ontology and mitigate that challenge. ¬© 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
98756;Knowledge engineering for competence assessment on serious games based on semantic web;Recognizing the inadequacy of traditional knowledge-based assessment systems in higher education to discover Learner competencies, we rethink the design of traditional assessment, using approaches that can both respond to the corporate requirements of the twenty-first century and reflect learners' competencies. The serious game sector has gained prominence in the last decade and the need to assess players' competencies in terms of knowledge, skills, and attitudes has grown. The assessment typically involves analyzing the player's performance in the game environment. At the same time, ontologies have emerged as one of the most popular and widely accepted tools in technology-enhanced learning and assessment. This paper proposes a framework for Competence Assessment based on ontological models for the generation of Personalized Assessment Scenarios, Assessment Portfolios and Personalized Assessment Paths on Serious games. Assessment Portfolios are used to track and store learners' interactions with the games, which can then be used as proof of competence during the assessment process. The personalized assessment scenarios on serious games are formalized with First Order Logic rules that are able to reason over resources annotated with Semantic Web metadata, thus allowing the reusability and interoperability of data. ¬© 2019 IEEE.
98805;Competency based approach: Modeling and implementation;The expansion of computer networks has at the same time given impetus to the distance learning environments. E-learning systems are also advanced and more efficient. However, these platforms offer such complex teaching functionalities that designers find themselves poorly equipped to succeed in their engineering processes. This article presents a tool that makes it easier for designers to produce educational content according to the Competency-Based Approach (CBA). We propose an implementation of the CBA after its modeling via ontology. Our module can be grafted to any author system oriented pedagogy based skills. We have advocated for Service Oriented Architecture as a software solution to model our business process that consists of a set of interconnected services that are modeled and implemented. The proposed system is the result of a coordination of, services, incorporating the order of competences explained by a distance education, which integrates and interacts according to an orchestration plan. ¬© Kassel University Press GmbH.
98807;A Knowledge-Model for AI-Driven Tutoring Systems;A powerful new complement to traditional synchronous teaching is emerging: intelligent tutoring systems. The narrative: A learner interacts with a digital agent. The agent reviews, selects and proposes individually tailored educational resources and processes - i.e. a meaningful succession of instructions, tests or groupwork. The aim is to make personal tutored learning the new norm in higher education - especially in groups with heterogeneous educational backgrounds. The challenge: Today, there are no suitable data that allow computer-agents to learn how to take reasonable decisions. Available educational resources cannot be addressed by a computer logic because up to now they have not been tagged with machine-readable information at all or these have not been provided uniformly. And what's worse: there are no agreed conceptual and structured models of what we understand by 'learning', how this model-to-be could be implemented in a computer algorithm and what those explicit decisions are that a tutoring system could take. So, a prerequisite for any future digital agent is to have a structured, computer-accessible model of 'knowledge'. This model is required to qualify and quantify individual learning, to allow the association of resources as learning objects and to provide a base to operationalize learning for AI-based agents. We will suggest a conceptual model of 'knowledge' based on a variant of Bloom's taxonomy, transfer this concept of cognitive learning objectives into an ontology and describe an implementation into a web-based database application. The approach has been employed to model the basics of abstract knowledge in engineering mechanics at university-level. This paper addresses interdisciplinary aspects ranging from a teaching methodology, the taxonomy of knowledge in cognitive science, over a database-application for ontologies to an implementation of this model in a Grails service. We aim to deliver this web-based ontology, its user-interfaces and APIs into a research network that qualifies AI-based agents for competence-based tutoring.  ¬© 2021 The authors and IOS Press.
98823;Ontology for continuous learning and support;Acquiring new knowledge and skills is the principal goal of any educational institution. Universities planned always to improve the learning methods to offer high academic competencies qualities for students. These competencies help students to respond to the needs of companies‚Äô missions during their internships. In some cases, some companies‚Äô missions required more competencies in a special domain activity. Therefore, we proposed our method based on a continuous learning ontology where a student can do his job with the support and assistance of a specific service or from his supervisor. This ontology will permit to take into consideration, in addition to competencies, the abilities of students to ensure interoperability between company and university by ensuring matching between the actual student skills and required mission skills. Thus, the proposed approach will establish an efficiency matching between the company needs and the students. Results show the benefits of such an approach to resolving the gap between industry needs and students‚Äô skills. ¬© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.
98824;Ontology of the CBA: Towards Operationalization and Implementation;"To remedy inefficiency and increase the quality of learning, training systems have adopted a pedagogical approach based on competence bases. It is a concept that is common to the academic and professional communities; which imposes the use of ontology of the CBA to conceptualize a dynamic repository, determining the terminological semantics of skills, which is sectorial with pedagogical norms. We propose a CBA ontology that focuses on explicit modeling of competency in order to provide a shared formal representation that promotes exchange, interoperability and collaboration among the various users in the learning systems. Our goal is not just to build an appropriate ontology. Our ambition is to implement this solution in an authoring system to assist tutors with didactic intentions based on skills to produce CBA based educational content. ¬© 2018, Springer International Publishing AG."
98841;From content management to E-learning content repositories;The concept of content in an educational context is very different from the one in other fields such as publishing or electronic newspapers, for example. From textbooks to exercises, from software simulations to data sets containing educational data, it is necessary to rethink the way these educational resources or learning objects are managed. One of the major concerns for teachers using e-learning environments is the availability of the appropriate structures and tools for organizing such learning resources and making them accessible to learners. This is especially true for e-learning virtual environments where learners have access to both digital libraries and also to any other Web resource, through Google or other conventional search engines. Nevertheless, these systems are usually not directly integrated in the learning process and content and metadata management requires the use of different tools. Furthermore, new pedagogical approaches consider the learner as an active element in the learning process, promoting the acquisition and development of competences through activities which involve the use and creation of learning resources. This chapter explores the relationship of traditional content management systems and the broader scope of virtual learning environments, including aspects of metadata standards, content personalization, the use of semantic web techniques and ontologies, the use and annotation of learning resources and the possibilities offered by the use of Web 2.0 technologies. At the end of this chapter, the possible learning scenarios that will be derived from all the changing forces, combining methodological, technological and organizational issues will be described. ¬© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
98878;Bridging the gap between competency based approach and intelligent tutoring systems;The Competency Based Approach (CBA) represents a real opportunity for the development of higher education in Morocco, combined with the advantages of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), this approach could well solve many problems, particularly the inadequacy between school teaching and labor market needs, the professional achievements enhancing, overcrowded classrooms, etc. Convinced by the undeniable contribution of technology to all teaching methods and based on our experience of CBA adoption, we propose an ontology and a conceptual technological architecture to allow the CBA to take benefit from the technological advances of ITS. To justify the interest of designing a new ITS architecture supporting the CBA, we will highlight the changes resulting from CBA adoption, in understanding, reasoning and competency modeling, also in learner modeling, learner pathway management and pedagogical engineering. ¬© Research India Publications.
98907;Interoperability framework for competences and learning outcomes;This research work was carried out in the areas of Higher Education, Teaching Technology and Web Information Management with the aim of developing a model for identifying and classifying competences and learning outcomes (MICRA) and an ontology of the information management model (SICRA). The MICRA model was applied in a case study, whereas the verification and validation of its previously defined functionalities led to ontology validation. MICRA shows to be an innovative model, based on a thorough, organized and systematic analysis of the educational context. In addition, SICRA goes beyond other ontologies as it not only defines reusable competences, classified according to Bloom¬¥s taxonomy, but also defines and establishes a correspondence among Computer Science Knowledge Areas. We have thus contributed to making learning institutions‚Äô training curricula widely available, allowing for their contrastive analysis in order to promote student and teacher mobility within the European Higher Education Area and in other countries. ¬© J.UCS.
98908;Knowledge-based model for curricular design in Ecuadorian universities;The contemporary generation of students needs to acquire competences that help them to exercise judgment and solve problems aiming to face current economic and technological challenges. On the basis of this understanding, competence-based education with its teaching and learning approaches has received a good deal of attention and support in recent years. In this sense, the correct design of curriculums represents one of the main means for the gradual and systematic formation of these competences. Despite this fact, in Ecuador there is not a knowledge management model for competence-based curricular design at university education level. Hence, in this work, we propose a knowledge-based model for the design of competencebased curriculums that allow professionals to use teaching and learning strategies that facilitate the development and demonstration of competence, thus contributing to the academic formation of high-level professionals in Ecuadorian universities. All aforementioned will be possible thanks to the implementation of a Cloud-based platform that combines current technologies such as social networks, data mining, and ontologies in order to provide Ecuadorian professionals with the means for the design of competence-based curriculums. ¬© Springer International Publishing AG 2016.
98910;An ontology-based learning system in IT project management;"This chapter presents a Web-based learning system in IT project management, capable of building and conducting a complete and personalized training cycle, from the definition of the learning objectives to the assessment of the learning results for each learner. The focus is on the content management solution, using an educational ontology and a competency catalogue, both of them developed by the author in line with the ICB 3.0 competency standard. Ontology-based learning is considered in the context of competency-based learning. The competency catalogue allows the identification of a possible gap between the reference and the actual competency profiles and the identification of the training requirements. An ontology-based project management learning approach allows one to find the most suitable educational programmes and training when there is a similarity but not an exact match between education and training offers and the competency gap. The development process is based on the state of the art IT technologies (metadata and ontology for knowledge manipulation, Web services, learner model, and intelligent tutoring systems). Besides interoperability and personalization, the proposed approach brings additional advantages, including: unitary interpretation of the content structure by different user categories or content providers; explicit specification of the knowledge domain, allowing the updating of the domain definition without major changes of e-learning tools and programmes; reuse of the learning objects with economical advantages by saving costs of (re)writing the content for the different course forms and strategies; reuse of the created tools in one domain in other domains; promoting the competency-based learning through the domain ontology and the relations between concepts and competencies. The results obtained in practice are very encouraging and suggest several future developments. ¬© 2011, IGI Global."
98922;Integration of competencies in an ontology-based framework supporting teachers to construct learning designs in the domain of sustainable energy education;In previous work, a framework based on three ontologies (content, learning design and sustainable energy domain models) was introduced in order to support teachers to con-struct learning designs in the field of sustainable energy education. This paper is focusing on the integration of a competency model in the structure of this framework. This model actually interconnects the other three models by establishing connections between learning objects, learners, activities, learning objectives/competencies and knowledge in the sus-tainable energy domain. It enriches the description of learning resources enabling their search and retrieval via queries based on competency parameters and can also support competency-based reasoning in order for the competency gaps to be filled. The competency model came as an answer to a literature review triggered by some results of a Wizard of Oz experiment along with the aim to integrate into the framework sets of questions supporting learning in sustainable energy domain.
98954;Enhancing ontology-based educational content search service with competency;In this paper we present a methodology for designing competency based web search framework using ontology to acquire the learning contents that meets the individuals' competency. We used ontology with OWL-DL to built competency ontology, content ontology and domain ontology to implement competency based contents search system. The basic ontology-based search system, however, lacks the method of ranking the search results. To present more appropriate learning contents for the learner, we applied competency clustering to rank the search results. ¬© 2008 IEEE.
98968;An ontology and a software framework for competency modeling and management;The importance given to competency management is well justified. Acquiring new competencies is the central goal of any education or knowledge management process. Thus, it must be embedded in any software framework as an instructional engineering tool, to inform the runtime environment of the knowledge that is processed by actors, and their situation toward achieving competency-acquisition objectives. We present here some of our results in the last 10 years that have led to an ontology for designing competency-based learning and knowledge management applications. Based on this ontology, we present a software framework for ontology-driven e-learning systems. ¬© International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).
98969;Affordances of machine-processable competency modelling;"Existing e-learning competency standards such as the IMS Reusable Definition of Competency or Educational Objective (IMS RDCEO) specification and the HR-XML standard are not able to accommodate the level of a competency described separately from its narrative description; the grading scale of a competency; the success threshold of a competency; or the structure of competency trees or hierarchies. The proposed competency model addresses these problems and reflects all relevant features of the learner's behaviour and their knowledge, skills, and attitudes that affect their learning and performance. Statements of competency are machine-readable. Machine processing can offer interoperable and reusable resources and applications that are pedagogically effective for e-learning and assessment. A competency statement which can be read, processed, and interpreted by machine contributes to the automatic generation of questions, distractors, and question sequences, and offers a semantic structure for further processing."
99039;The model of continuous profession-oriented learning in the e-environment based on a competence approach and academic knowledge management;The paper presents a model of continuous profession-oriented learning in the electronic environment at organizational, technological and learning levels. The learning level involves the application of modern technologies in e-pedagogies. The educational process is being built on the bases of iterative analysis, competence assessment and individual trajectories of learning. The organizational level implies the formation of integrated knowledge space which unites community of teachers from various higher educational institutions, research organizations and business enterprises within the system of academic knowledge management. At the technological level the members and partners of the integrated knowledge space are provided with appropriate instruments within the framework of social networks to develop educational and methodological materials, tosearch, to capture, to accumulate and to systematize knowledge with respect to the competence model'srequirements based on ontology method. The model aims at developing the methodology for creating and maintaining the intelligence systems to generate comprehensive competences. It enables the educationinstitutions to effectively solve the problem of enhancing the education quality and assurance to meet the requirements of the business innovative development in knowledge society.
99052;An ontology for describing competency-based curriculum at engineering careers;Nowadays universities need to define the curriculums and subjects of their careers using the concept of professional competencies. This implies properly identifying the knowledge, skills and aptitudes that a professional need to practise, and with it, the curricular activities that will allow him to achieve it. The definition of based-competency curriculums it is a new paradigm that requires changes in the way of teaching. In this work the authors propose an ontology that conceptualizes the idea of competencies in the formulation of the curriculum of subjects, focused on university engineering careers. This ontology is part of an ontology network developed previously by the authors. The idea is to take a step forward in the definition of e-learning semantic tools that give support to teacher in the formulation of the competencies and the selection of teaching material and assessment tools, establishing relationships between all of them to achieve the objectives. In this way, this work provides a conceptual framework that facilitates the definition of competency-based curriculums and allows relating it with the teaching and assessment methodologies to achieve the defined competencies. ¬© 2019 AISTI.
99102;Towards a semantic framework for lifelong integrated competency management and development;In the domain of technology-enhanced competency-based learning and training, there is an increased interest in the integration of competency-related information for supporting competency-driven decision-making purposes. Indeed, since competency development draws upon several related areas, including teaching subjects, instructional design, learning resource annotation, e-Portfolios and motivated by the need for an integrated and semantic-based approach to competency management and development, a series of ontological structures have been formalized and developed for each of these areas. This paper aims to provide a framework specification for lifelong competency management and development, called LCMDF. The main advantage of this framework lies in its ability to provide a unifying semantic foundation in the form of a set of controlled vocabularies for describing competencies and their related details within the contexts of technology-enhanced competency-based learning and training. Moreover, this framework provides a novel integrated model to support a wide range of use cases. The proposed framework results from reusing widespread international standards for competency modeling which helps designing and implementing interoperability architecture of semantically-enhanced competency-based learning/human resource (HR) systems. ¬© The British Computer Society 2019.

99161;An ontology-based multi-level semantic representation model for learning objects annotation;In technology-enhanced learning, semantic annotations have been employed to attach semantic metadata to learning materials in order to significantly enhance their accessibility by human users and machines as well. In this paper, we present an ontology-based multi-level semantic representation model that aims to enrich the description of learning objects with semantics regarding their subjects, competencies and instructional roles. More specifically, the proposed model uses three ontologies: a subject domain ontology describing the domain concepts and the relations that are covered by the subject matter being taught, a competency ontology describing the competency-related characteristics of learners and learning resources, and an instructional role ontology specifying the instructional role(s) a learning object can play in an instructional setting. To demonstrate the feasibility of our model, an illustrative example is given that explains how learning object semantics can be represented with different granularities. ¬© 2017 IEEE.
99195;Modeling competencies in competency-based learning: classification and cartography;Despite the importance of competency modeling for both individuals and organizations, there is a lack of a comprehensive literature review and a cartography for it. This paper aims to provide an in-depth overview of different approaches to competency modeling reported in the field of technology-enhanced com petency-based learning. This literature review is complemented by an additional overview of related initiatives toward modeling intended learning outcomes, learning opportunities, achieved learning outcome profiles of learners and competency maps. In addition, a cartography illustrating the relationships between some important models is proposed. The main purpose of this work is to provide researchers with a comprehensive review of the current status in this field as well as to highlight ongoing issues and challenges that need to be addressed. ¬© 2018 IEEE.
99199;Design of a learner model based on the competency-based approach ontology;Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have been subject of an effort of standardization in different aspects. Among these are the actors of the learning process. We are particularly interested in modeling the learner in order to better adapt their learning to today‚Äôs ITS. A number of architectures of the learner model (LM) have been proposed from different points of view. However, few works have integrated the aspect of competency. In this work, we propose a learner model based on the ontology of the competency-based approach (CBA) comprising two main specifications, a learner-competency centered model and a dynamic model that adapts to different learning contexts. ¬© Research India Publications.

223570;Competency-Based Personalization Process for Smart Learning Environments;This chapter is a synthesis on the role of competency models in smart learning environments. A formal definition of competency, integrating the notions of skill/attitudes, knowledge, and performance, provides a foundation for the discussion. Concrete examples and tools will illustrate the role of competencies to help personalize learning scenarios, a central goal for smart learning environments. Competency as an input to and as an outcome of the learning process will be integrated in a learning design methodology, including user models and e-portfolios. A method for comparing competency will serve in the definition of assistance agents or recommenders. Finally, a number of research challenges will be identified.
223572;An Ontological Approach to Support Design competency-based curriculum;Different methodological guidelines, lack of clarity in designing curriculum modules, as well as the diversity of definitions and conceptions presents in the competence approach are drawbacks for designers of competency-based curricula. This paper presents a system designed under an ontological approach, which aims to support the design of competency-based curricula. The system emphasizes aspects such as graduate profiles and curriculum modules. The ontology is a framework to formally describe the domain knowledge of curriculum design, ensuring a consistent and unambiguous vocabulary.
